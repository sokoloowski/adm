Hezbollah couldn't give a flying fuck about Lebanon. They care enough about Lebanon to propose Syria reoccupy it?

Lebanon's response to Israel’s attacks were completely just and proper. To attack Israel would have created much more death and destruction, and for what? Honour? What good is that when your land is occupied by the Israelis and half your population is either dead or left the country and the other half fighting each other?

The army’s response to Hezbollah’s occupation of West Beirut and skirmishes in the mountain was also just. For them to act offensively against Hezbollah would have jeopardized the unity of the army. If you haven't noticed Lebanon’s army is composed of more than a single religion.

Don't kid yourself; Hezbollah couldn't give two shits about Lebanon. They are Iran’s strongest militant wing bordering Israel. They provoked Israel into attacking them, what did Nasrallah hope to achieve? He wanted war, he wanted more power and that is the only way he knows how to get it.

If Hezbollah had any vested interest in the maintaining a sovereign Lebanon they should cut their puppet strings from Iran and should not ask to be occupied by Syrians.

Socially and politically Scotland has always been very different from England. It's maybe not clear to an outsider looking in and there's no quick or easy way to demonstrate it so that's perhaps another discussion entirely.

Outside of the city of London and the south east of England, *Scotland is the most productive wealth creating region in the UK.*

Please look at the GVA for Scotland for 2010, as far as I know figures for the whole of 2011 are not published yet. GVA (Gross Value Added) is a statistical analysis similar to GDP. Note that these figures are based on population productivity, any additional wealth from oil &amp; gas, the crown estates, excise duty and so on should be considered *on top* of these figures.


&gt;GVA is the value generated by any unit engaged in a production activity. It is measured at basic prices, excluding taxes (less subsidies) on products. GVA plus taxes (less subsidies) on products is equivalent to Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The main components of income based GVA are:

 * Compensation of Employees
 * Gross Operating Surplus (the sum of self employment income, gross trading profits and
surpluses, non-market capital consumption, rental income less holding gains)
 * Taxes (less subsidies) incurred as a result of engaging in production, independently of the
quantity or value of goods and services produced (e.g. business rates).

The gist of it is as follows. Take Scotland's strong GDP, now add to that the current wealth that pours out of Scotland and into the Westminster treasury. Wealth from oil, gas, the crown estates &amp; excise duty and so on. I think you can see where I'm going here.

No studies I am aware of have shown that there are other liquids the human body needs to be healthy, although you could make a decent case that bone broth is something most of us should be consuming regularly (see Deep Nutrition by Dr. Cate Shanahan).

Coffee is fine in moderation (1-2 cups a day), and tea seems to be fine to drink all day, although some people experience gastrointestinal distress or trouble sleeping at larger doses.

Alcohol is a mixed bag. Some studies show people that abstain completely have the longest lives, but others show moderate drinking can protect against cardiovascular disease in people with unhealthy lifestyles. 1-2 servings a day should be ok for men, 1 serving per day for women. Be careful about the sugar and gluten (if you're intolerant) that come in many drinks. Dry red wine, vodka and tequila have the least sugar. Food choices while drinking are probably going to be suboptimal.

Sodas, juices and ""sports drinks"" should all be avoided. They dose you with sucrose and fructose, without the fiber that they come with in nature that slows down their entry into the blood stream, which causes insulin resistance and other health problems.

Not without a time machine. Otherwise it’s just speculation.

&gt;We will always need a physical communications backbone. Wireless technologies are inherently limited by available wireless spectrum (we can't change the laws of physics) and unsuitable for many applications on the internet because of the additional latency.

This is the case today, but may not be the case tomorrow. No one can predict the future. Particularly in IT industry when innovations occur almost daily. Compound those innovations upon decades. The Internet as we know it has only been around over ten years. How can you say when the project completes in 2021 that fibers won’t be obsolete by then?

&gt;Fibre functions through the transmission of light. If new fibre technology comes out tomorrow, the end nodes of the fibre can be replaced and you can enjoy whatever bandwidth that offers (10,000 gbits or whatever). Who knows.

Laying cables across Australia isn’t exactly an efficient use of resource. There could be an innovation that makes even the transmission of light through fibre technology to be obsolete. What then?

&gt;When we laid copper wire decades ago, I don't think it was envisaged what would use it for ~80 years later. Personal computers weren't even in the realm of science fiction. Now we use copper to connect to the internet at up to 24mbits. Crazy.

Exactly my point. Our current internet speeds ought to a lot faster considering the tech available today. When we invested in copper tech we thought other innovations would not replace it. The same thing is likely to happen here. And I don’t want to funnel the public’s limited resources in gambits such as this.

&gt;Fibre is future proof. You will not find one credible individual that actually understands the technology who will argue that we should 'wait for development XYZ'.

I assure it is it not future proof. Stating something like that implies that people know what the future holds, which is impossible. Any credible individual that actually understands technology would not argue that fibre is future proof, on the grounds that future cannot be predicted.

&gt;PS; the NBN investment from the government is not included in the federal budget. Why? It's an investment. The business plans indicate the government will receive a return of 7%.

LOL well if the government says it’ll get a return of investment, then of course they will! The government is always right and truthful when it comes to profits and investment – just have a look at everything they touch in the world! It all turns to gold! And if it doesn’t, they can always socialise the losses and blame capitalism.

The only people that can lose is everyone in Australia.

&gt;The government, alongside private investors, have put up money for the project and fully expect to get it back plus more.

If that’s the case, why is the government doing and not one of those greedy capitalistic billionaires r/Australia love to hate? If this WILL provide a return with absolute certainty, why haven’t TPG/IINET burrowed a heap of money and done it when returns are virtually guaranteed?

&gt;How on earth you can mount opposition to the project is beyond me.

Yes, I can see how it would be. Either you are with /r/Australia, or you are against us.

The effect is created from the Special brew you'd get from one of the daily frenzyheart quests. You are supposed to mix the brew with the berries but if you drank the brew you'd grow a nice percentage every 10s of drinking. The basic brew was able to grow you 3 times.
So what you did was simply to summon your squire bank (from the crusader dailies) and put the brew into the bank, ask the dwarf for a new (since it wasn't unique) and you would get it. Put that in bank as well. (it stacked) and repeat until you had around 10-15 of them.
Then you went to Sen'jin village and grabbed the grow buff from the witchdoctor. (repeat until you got it). HS to Orgrimmar, start drinking some 3-4 minutes (you might throw up at times so you had to have extra so you could go back drinking even if you wasted a few).
This would give you roughly 1 minute of grow+firewater(taken earlier) or BigFeast+ 20 something ticks of growth from the Dwarf brew.

All that money that Bain investors earned was re-invested in an economy creating jobs. Perhaps it was not invested in the american economy but don't workers in other countries have a right to compete and attract capital by working harder for less wages which allows us to buy goods that are cheaper and of better quality.

The move also is likely to please privacy and civil-liberties groups that have raised concerns in the past over the dual roles of police and intelligence agencies.

Schmidt stressed today that anonymity and pseudonymity will remain possible on the Internet. ""I don't have to get a credential, if I don't want to,"" he said. There's no chance that ""a centralized database will emerge,"" and ""we need the private sector to lead the implementation of this,"" he said.

Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology, who spoke later at the event, said any Internet ID must be created by the private sector--and also voluntary and competitive.

""The government cannot create that identity infrastructure,"" Dempsey said. ""If it tried to, it wouldn't be trusted.""

You should read the entire article before making judgements.

Basically, such a project would be generated by the private sector and would be voluntary. Also, it would fall under the commerce department instead of any intelligence agency.

A fundie friend recently said to me I can't lack belief. I told him ""yes, I can, this is how I feel"". His reply was ""that can't be not true"".

I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/oa214/keys_to_victory_nfc_divisional_game/) on Monday, explaining everything in that article, even predicting a final score that's close to what the author predicts.

Here is a TL;DR of the entire thread:

49ers are 10th in the league on opponent's # of pass attempts, yet 8th in lowest opponent's completion %, and opposing QBs have had a 73.6 passer rating. They are 12th in the league for 20+ pass plays allowed, but are suspect to the deep ball. This is not a huge matter of concern, as the NO offense relies on throws to Darren Sproles, Marques Coltson and Jimmy Graham - short /medium throws and screens - as their main offensive production. These three make up *55.47%* of Drew Brees' targets. 49ers are 3rd in the league in interceptions, 8th in the league for passing TDs allowed.

A lot of Saints drives were sustained in the Detroit game because Detroit's LBers couldn't tackle Pierre Thomas on first contact. 49er linebackers are much bigger, faster and more talented, and Thomas - or Graham or Sproles - won't find the same opportunities against the front 7 of the 49ers.

NO's rush defense is skewed, as they are the league lowest for opponent's # of rushing attempts despite being top 3 in YPC allowed. A smart 49ers offense will run the ball often.

SF may have a bad redzone offense, but NO also has the 2nd worst redzone defense. NO is 6th in redzone offense, while SF is 4th in redzone defense. San Fran has allowed only 25% redzone scoring AT HOME. New Orleans, on the other hand, only scores 44% in the redzone away. All this, TDs only. Akers is the most reliable kicker in the NFC. No need to address that.

___________________________________________________

**Credit to Naly_D for the following**: Any team would have great defensive stats at home if their matchups were against these amazing HoF-quality QBs: Tavaris Jackson. Josh Freeman. Colt McCoy. John Skelton and Richard Bartel. AJ Feeley. They're the reason opposing QBs have a 67.1 rating against the 9ers at home (not the 73 you quoted - that's the whole season). QBs they've faced on the road have a passer rating of 80.1. Still no great shakes.

Granted Eli got picked twice and Big Ben three times, but in three games they and Romo accounted for 986 yards. The other 6 QBs only got 944 yards in 5 games.

_________________________________________________

Saints have faced Rodgers, Gabbert, Cam Newton, Josh Freeman, AJ Feeley, Matt Ryan, Jake Locker and Christian Ponder in their away games. QBs have a 100.5 rating in these games. You could argue that Rodgers, Newton and Ryan skew the stats but god damn.

Look at those defenses: Greenbay (awful), Jax (decent), Carolina (awful), Bucs (awful) Rams (awful), Falcons (decent), Tennesee (decent) and Minnesota (awful).

Here is Drew Brees' stat line in outside games (GB, Jax, Car, Bucs, Tennessee): 95.7rating 160/230 69.6% 1849yds 369.8ypg 8.0ypc 9TD 6INT. All 5 of those games were close.

NO averages 27.2 points away. San Fran averages 27.6 points at home.

NO averages 24.5 points allowed away. San Fran averages 10.9 points allowed at home.

NO has a scoring margin of +2.8 away. San Fran has a scoring margin of +16.8 at home.

Another reason why I say puny minds, is that it is reducing down you ""emotional vocabulary"" if you will. All of these faces used in rage comics are pretty much just extremes, so everything about a rage comic is hyperbolic and in the end disingenuous as a result. You can't tell any type of really effective story where someones emotions are just extremes because no realistic person is like that. This is why actually describing your emotions and actions takes time and craft to do, but not as much as you'd think once you dig into it.

Here's a link to a one-touch root for the epic 4g, assuming that it's still on the EG 30 or 31 kernels or the EK02 (check by hitting menu from the home screen, settings, about phone and find the kernel version near the bottom. There's a huge pile of numbers, but if you see EG 30, EG 31 or EK02 in the mix, this'll work for you). I've done it to three different E4GTs now and it's totally safe.

You'll run the program and, to really get full access to your phone, you'll want to select option A to root your phone. Once that's done, run it again and select option C to install clockwork mod.

Once you've done that, get clockworkmod's Rom Manager from the android market.

https://market.android.com/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5rb3VzaGlrZHV0dGEucm9tbWFuYWdlciJd

Install Rom Manager and load it up. Make sure that you Flash ClockworkMod Recovery, the very first option and select epic 4g touch. After that, scroll down to toward the bottom and select backup current rom. Your phone will reset and you should go to the recovery menu (think of it as bios for your phone), from there you should find an option to backup your current rom. Select that. The phone should take a few minutes to create a backup of your rom, which should work a lot like a restore point in windows.

From this point on, you should always be able to restore your phone back to this point should anything go wrong.

Now, here's what you can do with it.

This has a comprehensive list of custom roms, kernels and modems. I'm no expert, so my explanations of the following concepts my be inadequate or completely innacurate, but so far they've gotten my phones working just fine.

Roms are basically your OS version. Many of the custom roms look exactly like the current touchwiz interface with a lot of behind the scenes tweaks, like improved battery life, improved performance, blocked ads and wireless hotspots unlocked to name a few popular features.

I'd personally recommend UnNamed Rom. It does pretty much everything I want in a rom but looks good doing it.

Next we have kernels. Kernels (and this is where I'm really weak intellectually), as near as I can tell, are basically the underlying rules for how your hardware operates. A good kernel can drastically increase battery life and performance and a bad kernel can sink it. Most roms will come with a kernel designed explicitly for that rom, so you often won't have to mess with kernels. I've yet to do that.

Ah, modems. Long story short, just get on the EL13 modems and call it a day. They're approximately 40% faster than the EG30 modems and still a tad better (from my testing) than some of the later roms. Updating a rom doesn't seem to ever change the modems, so that's something you'll want to do manually.

Modems are flashed just like roms.

When in doubt, just check out qbking77's guides on youtube or check out the xda forums.

In my opinion, you haven't really experienced what your phone can do till you've rooted it and flashed a custom rom to it. Hope this helps.",0,,Android,,t1_c3gvkwi,2015-07-01 12:52:58.000000,,

This makes craft skills a question of optimization and minmaxing like every other aspect of MMO characters' combat capability, subject to constant balancing buffs, nerfs, and people asking/deciding what is ""best"" for a given class/raid/whatever.  Your craft skill rating basically becomes Alternate Advancement experience from EQ.

The other way is to make the crafting game economic.  Under this model, crafted goods are useful, but wearable by anyone; characters select crafting skills based on what they would like to make and sell to other players, subject to supply and demand.  Being a particular type of crafter can also have unique noncombat perks - special appearance or home customization or title rewards - but the primary purpose of the crafting system is to encourage trade, not getting to 400, making yourself some re-usables once, and then forgetting it forever.",0,Koln | Sage | Lord Adraas,swtor,Consular,t1_c3gwp87,2015-07-01 12:52:38.000000,,

My personal opinion is that yes, there are (perhaps subtle) but existent effects of language on cognition and vice versa.

I don't recall the title of the article where I read this; it may have been a news publication, but the gist of it was that the phonology of the language could have something to do with the way people express themselves in different languages.

An example from that article was the German word for key - ""Schlusse"" if I recall, compared to another languages (which I don't recall). Schlusse was described as more guttural or something and the other somehow else.

This type of analysis seems promising, especially if the production model of language learning is valid. Even physiologically there would seem to have to be an effect.

But it's a super-complex issue; the words might average out within a language, the phrasal constructions may balance it out, the culture may be different; probably too many factors to reliably quantify.

But from personal experience, and this is of course the end-result of both just the languages themselves and the cultures, I'd say that there is certainly an effect (regardless of cause), if only due to state-based memory, of the language one is using at a time on their cognition at that time.

My citing the wikipedia article and other studies such as a 2000 CDC study and dogbites.org statistics that 71% of all fatal dog bites between 2005 and 2011 are attributable to ""pit bull types"" is that I am trying to illustrate that there is a common denominator to ALL of the attacks and it is that ALL cases involved large dogs and MOST cases (including the cases involving other breeds) involved a mistreatment of the animals. Yes, 71% is more than the 44% of responsible Rottweilers, but that 71% are listed as ""pit-bill types"" and not ""American Bull Terriers"" or ""Pure Bred Staffordshire Terriers""; the reliability of the statement that pit bull dogs are violent by breed based on these statistics is not valid because there are so many more variables to take into account. If you could show that each of these attacks were carried out by 100% AKC confirmed pure-bred ""pit bull type"" dogs, I could understand your deductions. However, we don't know what these dogs are mixed with. All of these attacks atributable to ""pit-bull types"" could be dogs that are half American Pit Bulls and half Rottweiler. There is no accurate way of knowing what breeds are in what animal so simply saying ""pit bulls kill"" is simple and idiotic.

The 2000 CDC study cited statistics that said that the majority of dog bite fatalities could be attributed to ""pit bull type"" dogs, however they publish in their paper that ""There is currently no accurate way to identify the number of dogs of a particular breed, and consequently no measure to determine which breeds are more likely to bite or kill."" They mention not only is it impossible to determine which breed is more likely to kill, but there is not enough evidence worldwide to make a broad, policy defining generalization about one breed or another.

Now, is it ok to play it safe and keep ""pit bull types"" from kid's playgrounds or from roaming the nieghborhood unattended? Sure. I dont agree with it, but its up to whoever is in charge of making laws to do things they feel makes the population safe. Is it ok for you to be afraid of pit bull breeds? Sure, Im not one to judge.

It's like reading a comic book where you spend five minutes on one panel that might change ever so slightly (A character appeared! A character disappeared! One of the character's facial expressions changed ever so slightly!). And while it seems like it wouldn't be a huge issue, clicking to change the text... it starts to drive you mad. Most let you set it to auto scroll through the text, but that has its own set of problems (either it's still too slow at max speed, or it outpaces you, or it's roughly the right speed, but each line has to show up a little bit longer than it would otherwise, because the game has to make sure you don't get left behind if you take a little bit longer on one line) Anyone who hasn't tried to play one of these, go get a book and a computer mouse. Now before you read each sentence, click the mouse. Every time. And don't just do this for a minute - depending on the game, scenes can take up to ten minutes or more, reading at a relatively brisk pace. And a scene change is only a short reprieve, because dammit, it's going to happen all over again in the next scene. Not to mention, in my experience there is rarely any effort to make the delay between clicking the mouse and changing the text on screen imperceptible. I mean, yeah, immediately is impossible, but I don't need a little effect emphasizing that the text has changed - I just want more text dammit.

If you want to be told a story through dialogue, occasional narration, and pictures, go pick up a comic book. If you want a story that you have some influence in the outcome of, go play a relatively open ended game, or just go buy one of those choose your own adventure novels (most visual novels will have your actions influence the course of the story, but understand that this is not terribly frequently at all.

Why not just vaccinate against everything?? Yellow fever? Malaria? How about tuberculosis? anthrax? The anthrax vaccine has been given to our military and is especially controversial and has been associated with adverse events. The reason is that there are very real risks associated with certain vaccines that may outweigh the benefit from immunity to the respective pathogen.

 Cochrane (gold standard for clinical practice) and other working groups make recommendations based on these. Check out this Cochrane review regarding the efficacy and safety of the flu vaccine in certain populations-- essentially they found that it was no better than placebo in children under two-- thus an unwarranted risk.

The economic/philosophical argument is based around the idea of that people choose to work in sweatshops for their own gain. Sweatshops by and large do not detract from the local populations employement options, it adds to them. This option is so good in fact, that there is a huge migration phenomenon where young rural workers abandon their traditional farming life to work in the city. People choose to work in factories, China is experiencing the largest human migration in history right now because it is so enticing that people are giving up their old lifes for it, to them it is a huge opportunity to improve their own lives. On the economic side, its basic economics that increased demand for labour (from more and more outsourcing through sweatshops) increases labour wages. Wages in China are actually rising at unprecedented rates and will continue to do so. Source: http://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2011/03/18/china-faces-years-of-double-digit-wage-increases-currency-appreciation/
The historic argument for sweatshops is that from our perspective in developped countries, things look bad compared to us but this is an inevitable process that EVERY rich country today went through as well. The first country to industrialize, the UK, had terrible labour conditions, child labour was the norm, pollution was abundant etc. in the mid 1800's. Same with Canada, and the US (very poor resource extraction working conditions, and years of slavery respectively) which both had their own fair share of uglyness too. For every rich country you can point to about 50 years where things were bad, but growing. The 1800's were a period of extreme growth and transition for Western countries, but many of the undeveloped world has yet to experience that magic transition period. China isn't going to instantly quintuple its GDP and raise its standards of living instantly, right now it is going through a long process of industrialization that we've seen countless times before. In 20 -30 years, things will be alot better for the billions that live there, but they can't get there instantly. It will be a process of improved education, capital accumulation and increasing worker productivity that will get it there. It is well on its way right now, they are certainly driving growth quite well by shifting from an agriculture based industry to a manufacturing based industry.

* Enemies shoot at your teammates instead of just you.
**I see enemies hitting other NPCs plenty of times during the campaign, though generally that applies for all games and it one of the most annoying AI traits that needs to be worked out in the future along with always knowing where you are.**
* No regenerative health. Health kits instead.
**In all honesty, if I never had to look for another health kit again I would die a happy man, until we have some sort of full control of our character and AI reaches a level where we aren't always the main target and can easily screw us over in all sorts of ways because games are no where near perfect then I would rather they didn't bring them back.
Resistance 3 tried it, some people liked the ""old school"" nature of it and some just down right didn't like it at all.**
* At least some degree of multiple routes to take in a level even if the destination is the same (pseudo-linear/fork).
**This is another one that should apply for every game in general, but at this point most games are either ""open"" for you to do what you want and come pretty bug ridden (i'm looking at you Bethesda) or they force you down a general path and it is generally a more polished experience, i imagine it will be something that appears further down the line.**
* Co-operative mode.
**Not as easy as some people might think, you have to play test the whole game again with multiple people instead of just throwing people through and checking as much as you can, this can make balance issues even more apparent, a lot of games which just double the enemies or give them more health which to me seems like the laziest way possible to make a game harder for multiple platers.**
* Only hold a few clips of ammo, not ten (for balance reasons).
**Remember these are games, people don't always want realism, everyone plays different and not everyone has the same level of skill that might be required because they took most of the ammo away and they have terrible aim, seems like a lazy way to balance a game.**
* More missions where you can control a helicopter strike at any time or whatever, it gives you a sense of freedom in that you can approach the mission in more than one way.
**Up for debate I guess, you talk about balance and then say you want to hand the player what is generally considered a win button for shoot outs.**
* I wouldn't have made MW2's story so desperately tryhard at being Jason Bourne worthy.
**Personally I would just go in not expecting a great story, CoD is very much the video game summer movie, films have been around a lot longer and most still have pretty terrible stories so I don't think we will generally see any sort of massive improvement any time soon, but the MW3 just felt like them trying to put together a story they screwed around with and was all over the place in MW2.**

In the multiplayer:

* Simplify the weapon customization system.
**Not sure how simple you need to make it, you can select a few things for each weapon as it is, most don't even effect the weapon in anything other than look, it is pretty simple as it is.**
* Put some more thought into balance of the weapons so that who wins is more about skill than what weapon you are using - you might have a teensy, eency damage advantage over your opponent (at the sacrifice of a teensy, eency bit of accuracy), but it mostly comes down to who has the better aim.
**Nothing will ever be perfectly balanced in a MP game, a lot of games that when put out to the masses end up with some sort of screwed weapon balance towards certain items. If you made everything skill based a good portion of players would probably stop playing, people buy and love CoD for it's arcade like nature and not its dependancy on you being incredibly skilled with analogue sticks.**

* I'd put more effort into preventing hackers. Patch more often/quickly, maybe employ moderators, log unusual activity and such.
**This is a given for every game, they already have a system in place for certain features to be changed and tweaked, I know Uncharted 3 has one too where they don't need to patch it normally and can just update it in-game but both games still have certain things that seemingly have to be run past the console makers before being pushed to users, but they definitely need to be quicker about it. it looks like they cancelled one of their events because of a weapon glitch someone found and now loads of people are walking around with**
* Put more of an emphasis on team-based gameplay, particularly in the team-based mods, for god's sake! You'll get more points for assisting teammates and doing challenges/accolades that help the team.
**They already do this to some degree with points for killing someone who kills team mates or giving you larger amounts of points for taking bases for instance, but I would definitely give few points for kills in games like Domination, it is ridiculous the number of people that avoid objectives to camp out for kill streaks and points.**
* I'd severely tone down the involvement of killstreaks in a game. Getting 7 kills in a row should not give you the ability to change the whole pace/balance of the current game.
**People love kill streaks and I really don't see a problem with them, I can't think of any besides say the EMP that you can't combat with something else, any of the air vehicle kill streaks for instance can be easily taken down in 1-3 missles, what I would do is limit the number at the same time, teams shouldn't be able to call in almost each air vehicle kill streak at the same time as that is what can heavily turn the tide of a game.
And if anything with their new support kill steak package people now have a choice to get kills that go towards helping the team or killing the enemy, I've found it to be a great way to deal with the general issues of past CoD games**
* Severely tone down the boosts and benefits that perks give you.
**I agree and disagree, some are definitely too useful, I don't take off ""Assassin/Pro"" because it is simply too useful while playing.
Though some such as Dead Silence seem a bit pointless, the games sound isn't great to begin with and it's pro version is to let you have no fall damage which I think is completely pointless on a game that is full of maps that are 95% horizontal.**
* Remove death streaks because you should not be rewarded for being bad.
**I don't agree with this, the point of death streaks are to get people back in the game when they die a lot, they do just that by helping you get kills and such like that are there to improve you experience, no one likes dying a lot and this is really the best way to handle it without making it too powerful, making it too easy for everyone or oppositely making it harder for those not so good at the game.**
* Larger maps.
**Not sure what larger maps would do, there are some bigger maps already that can be a drag to run across in smaller games and some maps that are too small for bigger games, if they went say battle field size people would find it too boring to play without means of getting around.
Which brings up vehicles, adding vehicles would create a whole new level of balance that would have to be dealt with, and a lot of games that do have vehicles have issues with vehicles then being too powerful or useless.**",0,,truegaming,,t1_c3hasi1,2015-07-01 12:48:08.000000,,

&gt;Given the epidemic levels of sexual violence and the widespread availability of increasingly graphic pornography in the United States, it is not surprising that researchers and activists have tried to answer the question of whether there is a connection between men's use of pornography and sexual violence. Since legal controls on sexually explicit material began to loosen dramatically in the 1970s and the issue attained a new visibility, a variety of different methods have been used to try to answer that question, or at least provide clues to the answer. After two decades of research, there is little consensus, not only as to that answer but as to definitions of terms, appropriate methods of investigation, or even how to frame the question. This essay will attempt to highlight the most relevant aspects of these disputes and reach tentative conclusions that can guide people working in the field.

&gt;Two terms often used in common parlance for sexually explicit material---obscene and indecent---have specific meanings in the law. ""Obscenity"" is that category of sexual material that the courts have deemed to be outside full protection of the First Amendment and subject to regulation by the state. Obscene material is defined as that which appeals to the prurient interest in sex, depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value ( Miller v. California, 1973).

&gt;""Indecency"" is a term from broadcasting (radio and over-the-air television) that defines an even broader category that can be regulated -- language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community broadcast standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory organs or activities ( Federal Communications Commission, 2004).

I don't want to argue about whether pornography should be regulated or not but I really believe that r/beatingwomen is not protected under the first amendment. It is overtly obscene and definitely falls under the category of overly violent pornography(even though some post aren't sexual, there is definitely some type of sexual element to it.

&gt;In other contexts the term[pornography] is juxtaposed to erotica, which typically is defined as material that depicts sexual behavior in a context of mutuality and respect. In that dichotomy, pornography is defined as material depicting sex in a context of domination or degradation. In many laboratory studies of pornography's effects, three categories of pornography are created: overtly violent; non-violent but degrading; and sexually explicit but neither violent nor degrading.

The occupation of Palestine by the Jews hinges on the assumption of their historic connection with the land.

Is this true?

The truth is that the connection to Palestine of even those Jews who can genuinely claim to have Hebrew forebears is tenuous at best because never, at any time, did the Hebrews occupy the whole of Palestine.

In 3000 BC the earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Canaanites, some 1800 years before the first Hebrews.

In about 1730 BC Hebrew tribes came from Ur, having been sold into bondage and they only moved out of Egypt and into Palestine about 1000 BC. The Egyptians called them ""Hebrews"" which meant ""wanderers"". At this time the Hebrews settled in mainly unoccupied regions and had neither a kingdom nor a central government.

In 721 BC the kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians and the people were carried into bondage. The kingdom became extinct and in its place were four Assyrian provinces.

In 587 BC the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and carried the Jews into captivity. This marked the end of Jewish rule in Palestine, but not the end of Jewish presence.

In 538 BC the Babylonians lost Palestine to the Persians and allowed the Jews to return.

In 332 BC Alexander the Great took Palestine from the Persians and a century and a half later the Greeks were confronted with the revolt of the Maccabees.

In 164 BC Judas Maccabee liberated Jerusalem. An event the Jews celebrate in the festival of Hanukka.

But Jewish independence in Jerusalem and some other parts of Palestine did not last. In 124 BC Jerusalem was besieged by the King of Syria. The siege was raised only after the payment of tribute.

Then in 63 BC the Romans captured Palestine and it became, as Judea, a province of the Roman Empire. The Jews revolted against the Romans in AD 66 to 70 and again in AD 132 to 135. In the first revolt Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus. In the second most of the Jews still in Palestine were killed or dispersed to the far corners of the Roman Empire.

In 135 AD Hadrian built a new city of Jerusalem, which he named Aelia Capitolina, and none of the very few Jews who remained in Palestine were allowed to live in it.

Therefore, the Jewish connection with the area as a people lasted little more than six hundred years and ended approximately 2,000 years ago.

In 1846 ""Sir"" Moses Montefiore made what appears to be a reconnaissance trip to Palestine at the behest of ""Lord"" Rothschild and reported that the Jewish population of Palestine at that time was around 9,000. These people presumably were residents of long-standing and could justly be called Palestinians.
Are all Jews Semitic?

To that question the answer is ""no"". In other words they are not by any means all descendants of the Hebrews.

Many are descendants of Jews by conversion in the many lands where they were citizens. Conversions that took place long after the first Jewish presence in Palestine was all but extinguished.

The great majority of Russian, Polish, German and Baltic Jews, (providers at the turn of the nineteenth century, of what can be termed political Zionism's hard-core) descend from the Khazars, a Tartar people of Southern Russia, who were converted in a body to Judaism at the time of Charlemagne (around 740 AD.)

The Khazars were a semi-nomadic Turko-Finnish people who settled between the Volga and the Don. When Khazaria fell to the Mongols in the 13th century, its population of Jewish-convert Khazars moved north-west to become the progenitors of the Ashkenazim Jews. These Khazar Jews greatly outnumbered the racially Hebraic Jews who had reached Europe by other routes and at other periods of history. Therefore the majority of Eastern European Jews were not Semitic and, as most western European Jews came from eastern Europe, they are not Semitic either.

This makes their occupation of Palestine invalid on both counts.

It also explains why there has been such emphasis on the use of the term ""anti-Semitic"" rather than ""anti-Jewish"", with the obvious intention of inferring that the Jews are Semites. Correctly ""anti-Semitic"" can only be used to describe the activities of the Jews against the Arabs, who are a Semitic people and whose uninterrupted presence in the Middle East goes back for millenia.

Undoubtedly casting doubt on the genetics of the Ashkenazim Jews is a sensitive point for Israel. The 2007 film ""Borat"" of Baron Cohen made an attempt at a spoof - laughter is always a good method of shuffling out of a tricky situation.

In May 9 2007 an article by Steven Plaut ""The Khazar Myth and the new Anti-Semitism"" appeared on the Jewish Press web site, where the author goes to some length but limited success to disprove the claim that the Ashkenazim Jews are descendants of the Khazars, the Turkic tribe who lived in southern Russia between the Black and Caspian Seas and converted en bloc to Judaism. They are dismissed by him with the words ""they were an archaic group of people in central Asia who disappeared a millenium ago"". He apparently deems it politic to ignore the Karaim Jews who still live in that area and are some of the descendants of that conversion.

The book of Exodus specifies that the male descendants of Aaron (the brother of Moses) should constitute the priesthood - the Kohabim - ""for all time"".

In 1997 the world was amazed to learn that the old Bible story had found new and very specific scientific support, the haplotype common to 42% of Ashkenazi levi'im was found to have the same genetic marker, the origins of which appear to derive from Central Asia not from the Middle East. Where did that Central Asian haplotype come from? It looks as though the Khazar Jews created their own native class of levi'im.

An attempt to back away from the lack of Semitic blood with the claim that the Jews are not racist (tell that to the Palestinians)with the statement that anyone who is a genuine convert is welcomed is equally questionable. What then of the increasing division in Israel between those with only one Jewish parent and the true full-blooded Jew? Gentile women who marry a Jew are required to ""convert"" in order that any children of the marriage will be regarded as Jews.Why are the Ethiopian Jews side-tracked? Their conversion to Judaism is so ancient that they know nothing of the Talmud?

The Jewish claim to Palestine viewed from any aspect is not only shaky but would be laughable if it hadn't caused so much misery to the legitimate occupants of the country. It would be equally justifiable (and equally ridiculous) for the descendants of the Celts, i.e. the Irish, the Scots and the Welsh to transport themselves lock-stock-and-barrel to the area of La Tene and Halstatt in Europe, from which their ancestors originally came.

Nobody has explained how GoldenEye 007 side-stepped its roots in order to win console gamers.  Nobody has explained why computer gamers have an issue with the controller as the popular input device for the genre.  Somebody needs to discuss how we got from “Doom clones” to “Half-Life, Deus Ex, System Shock 2, Unreal Tournament, Quake 3: Arena, and Thief: The Dark Project all released in a span of nineteen months” to “thirty-one flavors of urban warfare”, and why it annoys the piss out of long-time gamers.

&gt;Think about what you're saying for a second. Just because the Bedouins have lived in that rough area for decades doesn't give them the right to ignore Israeli law. **They even acknowledge that they have no legal right to this particular land!** Your argument breaks down 'the Bedouins lived in the area for a long time, ergo they shouldn't have to follow the law'. That is absurd.

&gt;The point you seem to be missing is the fact that **just because the Bedouins lived in the region for a long time does not make that specific plot of land by Ma'ale Adumim theirs.** Are you at all familiar with the Bedouin lifestyle? Bedouins are a nomadic people. That means that they don't stay in one place for an extended period of time. Yes, these people lived in Israel however they did not establish cities. They constantly moved about in the desert. **Israel is not tearing down longstanding Bedouin towns or cities. It is not tearing down homes that they've lived in for generations. What Israel is doing is removing makeshift tents and shacks that have never had any permanency or legitimacy.**

&gt;**So while these Bedouins have lived in Israel for a very long time, they have absolutely NOT lived on those particular plots of land near Ma'ale Adumim for a very long time.

Thus, everyone here is a fan of a foreign club, with or without a secondary domestic club they prefer.

If I have to give a reason other than ""my dad was a United-fan,"" I'd say it's the spirit of the club.

It's a club where the team is greater than the sum of its parts, a club that has been consistently in the top for so long despite often competing with clubs that can buy more/better players.

Islam doesn't condone rape, in fact, it is the most just against the rapist and the kindest towards the rape victim. Part of the issue is your selective reading without context, and probably, lack of knowledge about human rights in Islam. You're also mixing your conclusion with the Bible, which does allow rape: **“Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to be refractory…” (Titus 2:9)**

Anyway, the way Islam sets up rights for people is by first handling their hearts, and then, having it issued by law. The Prophet pbuh also took gradual steps when handling alcohol &amp; interest. If Islam chose to handle it by law first, no one would have followed it, and you would have ended up with something along the lines of the Prohibition in the US, which was a total failure.

p.s. When the Prophet pbuh reacted, he was referring to ejaculation inside vs ejaculation outside and it's affect on pregnancy.

Given that someone will end up in charge, I'd rather that someone is chosen by the people, for specific purposes, than for that someone to choose himself by virtue of the fact that he has the most guns.

I feel like a lot of people are not truly aware to the extent of hostility and belligerence Iran has displayed against Israel for the last couple decades. It should not come as a surprise to anyone the way Israel is reacting. It quite hypocritical for Iran to now express outrage that its being targeted on its soil.

Here is just a brief overview:

Hamas:

1. Starting in the early 1990s, Iran pledged military and financial support – reportedly $30 million annually – as well as advanced military training for thousands of Hamas activists at Revolutionary Guard bases in Iran and Lebanon.

2. When Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh visited Tehran in December 2006, Iran reportedly pledged $250 million in aid.

3. Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal visited Tehran in February 2009, after the war ended, to thank Iran for its help during the conflict, citing Iran as a “partner in victory.”

Islamic Jihad:

4. The Sunni Muslim group adopted the suicide tactics used mainly by Shiite militants, justified as martyrdom for the greater cause. Since 1989, it has carried out more than a dozen major suicide attacks against Israeli targets.

5. The groups leader Shallah reportedly attended a meeting in Tehran in 1996, when he coordinated with the Qods Force, an elite wing of the Revolutionary Guards that handles Iran’s foreign operations.

6. Iran has armed, trained and funded Islamic Jihad, although its aid is reportedly modest compared with support for Hamas or Lebanon’s Hezbollah.

Economic systems serve to allocate resources to where they are most needed. In the case of stocks, this means putting money behind companies that have the most need for it, measured in potential for profits, since profits are fundamentally a reflection of consumer demand.

For example, as demand for solar panels has increased over the last decade, the stock price of solar companies has increased as a reflection of the fact that these companies now need resources that our society previously devoted to other tasks, such as perhaps coal mining. A group of people saw that solar technology could be profitable they sold other stocks to buy shares in solar companies.

A tax on trading creates inefficiencies because it creates an unnecessary incentive not to sell shares and reallocate the resources to where they could be better used. Inefficiency is of paramount importance because an inefficient economy is an economy where resources could be put to better use.

I'm no fortune-teller (nor is anyone who makes claims about the future), but I'd wager lawyers would be ***a lot*** more willing to take a case on contingency if the system weren't set up to allow corporate lawyers to simply out-spend plaintiffs until the money they're using to sue dries up.

You know I sometimes wonder if the world would be a richer or poorer place without copyright, plenty of things would be different, certainly and those who make their money from the current system will of course tell you the world would be a poorer, worse off world for it.

It's almost taken as a given that the world would have less creativity without copyright but I do wonder.

Imagine a world where in the 17th century someone had decided that recipes and cooking should fall under copyright along with books.

You can be sure that were someone to call for it's repeal 300 years later there would be no lack of ""professional recipe composers"" who would talk about how much work they put into working out new recipes and the time and effort it takes and how we're bad people for implying that they haven't worked hard and that they somehow don't deserve a cut whenever someone follows their recipes.They'd talk about how hard it is running a business creating recipes, how bad it feels when they see someone using their work without paying.

and they'd be totally honest. They really would have worked hard. they probably would find it hard running a business and they probably would feel bad seeing people using their IP rights without paying them.

In a world where such legal protections existed and nobody ever knew such an open and unprotected situation as we have in this world it would be very easy to claim that there would be no creativity, no well paid chefs and that setting up a kitchen would be pointless since someone else would just copy the chefs recipes.

""Imagine a world where cooking wasn't covered by IP law you'd never be able to set up your own restaurant!"" they'd say.

""Why would a chef ever come up with a new recipe?
Surely if he came up with a good one then McDonalds would just steal it and include it in their own chain and lock that chef out.""

""As soon as you came up with a good idea, theme or dish someone would just swoop in , copy your ideas and push you out of business.""


""Nobody would ever even try!
We'd all be stuck without anything good to eat!""


of course in a world where we're all free to take someone else's recipe, use it, copy it, publish it or even claim it as our own we know very well that fuck all harm has been done to the industry for the lack of legal protection on such creativity.

We live in a world where everyone has family recipes but hardly anyone has family music.


Similarly it's taken almost as a given that the world would have less good books, less good stories and less originality without copyright but try questioning that even for a moment.

If the chef at your local restaurant had to pay royalties whenever he used a recipe published by a celebrity chef would you have a tastier and more enjoyable meal?
What if he risked being sued into the ground if he created a derivative work by altering the recipe slightly without a license?
or would you just have a more bland, unoriginal, uninspired and ultimately vastly more expensive meal?

If your hairdresser had to pay royalties whenever some kid comes in with a magazine picture and says they want their hair to ""look like that"".

Would everyone have far more interesting hairstyles or would it just cost far more and see people getting sued for doing their own hair at home in a copyrighted style?

Both these things are creative and also involve a skill much like storytelling or playing a musical instrument and in both cases I've read of attempts by various groups trying to get copyright protections extended to cover them.


Of course someone is going to complain that composing a recipe, coming up with a hair style or cooking a good meal aren't creative.

Allopathic medicine refers to the practice of conventional medicine that uses pharmacologically active agents or physical interventions to treat or suppress symptoms or pathophysiologic processes of diseases or conditions.[1] It was coined by Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843), a homeopath, in 1810. Although ""allopathic medicine"" was rejected as a term by mainstream physicians, it was adopted by alternative medicine advocates to refer pejoratively to conventional medicine.

Much of this evidence focuses on the US gov't/FDR having a *deliberate* *policy* to provoke Japan into attacking the US. After the fall of France in the spring of 1940, FDR feared England would be defeated and Nazi Germany would rule Europe unchecked. So FDR sought to unite the US and to enter the war through the ""back door"", using the Japanese-German alliance; thus creating a policy of provoking Japan to attack us.

In Herbert Hoover's recently-released journals, we know that Hoover claimed FDR was deliberately provoking Japan to do this.

But the groundbreaking work was done by WWII Navy veteran, journalist and author Robert Stinnett, released in his book ""[Day of Deceit](http://www.amazon.com/Day-Deceit-Truth-About-Harbor/dp/0743201299)"". (An [overview/interview with Stinnett](http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=408).)

Stinnett used Freedom of Information Act requests to uncover US logs monitoring Japanese communications, and a shocking memo written by a naval intelligence officer who routed communications between the White House and Navy which outlined an 8-step plan to provoke Japan into attacking the US. In the book, Stinnett documents how the 8 steps were enacted, all leading to provoking Japan into attacking.

The work of Stinnett and others is so pervasive it cannot be seriously questioned.

My impression of dubstep has been that it could be good incidental music or have commercial applications (runway music, car commercials, etc), but because it sounds like a transformer cat in a pre-mating fight, does not maintain any rhythm (or even a catchy lack thereof like ragtime), and has absolutely no melody whatsoever, I never understood the appeal when it comes to general listening.  By any reasonable definition, it's not music.  It is a sequence of sound effects strikingly similar to what you hear when your audio card dies while playing a video.  I could make the same ""music"" by randomly corrupting a pointer in my sound card's driver and using my phone to record the result.  Dancing to a fistfight in Loony Tunes makes as much sense to me.

I can't tell who you seem to have a bigger stiffie for - Ben Swann, or the hottie newscaster that introduces him.  What I can tell, however, is you have completely mis-read (intentionally, I assume) what voodomurphy said.  That being:

&gt;I didn't realize **these writers had come forward** and said ""It was me. I did it"" had happened.

Your videos don't show this, so please stop trying to trot them out every single time as some sort of universal answer.  Intrepid young Ben refers specifically to a single ""1993 Ron Paul Strategy Guide"" in that video -- but the Hate Whitey Day quote came from [a February 1990 newsletter](http://www.mrdestructo.com/2011/12/game-over-scans-of-over-50-ron-paul.html).  So your videos don't prove a damn thing.

Look, the indisputable fact is that Dr. Paul is willfully *protecting* whomever it was on his staff that wrote some incredibly hateful, despicable content and profited handsomely from the readership it pandered to - NWO conspiracy theorists, gold bugs, and racists/xenophobes.  Dr. Paul could do *tons more* to distance himself from some of those awful things that were penned under his name -- but he is intentionally choosing not to.

You've got diehard fanboys that think Skrillex is the messiah, and then you've got pretentious dubstep hipsters who discredit Skrillex purely because he's Skrillex. Then there's people who hate dubstep altogether, but they don't count.

Personally, I like Skrillex. I think he's spearheading the dubstep genre, he's at the very front of the scene. He has his own sound, and it's original, I really dig it; and this is coming from someone who used to detest dubstep. He blew up pretty fast and it's really cool watching his career skyrocket like it is. Even more so, he's a pretty decent guy outside of music. He believes in what he does, and he does it to the best of his ability and I can always respect that.

I think dubstep is probably the most important music on the scene today. It's what you saw back in the day with punk and metal, in our time. It's offensive, loud, upbeat, and extreme, but at the same time it's really creative and unique. It doesn't abide or try to be friendly, it knows its audience. In a world where Nickleback is Rock and Roll, Beiber is Hip-Hop, and a world where pop-rock exists at all, dubstep is a refreshing change to the game. I mean, you can go to any college campus party, not having anything in common with the people there, and you can talk dubstep with a lot of people, it's astounding just how much it's blown up and how excited it's got people. It's what metal was 30-40 years ago.

At least, that's my opinion. Not to say that Skrillex compares to the Misfits or Slayer or WASP, I'm just saying that Dubstep has stepped up to be just as loud and offensive as they were back in the day. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe dubstep is the disco of today, maybe in 2020 I'll look back at this post and say ""wow, what a dumb thing to say"", but as it stands, I dig the wubwub.

You were the one claiming that Israel is ethnically cleansing the Palestinians. Considering Israel is not facing any sanctions it is only logical for Israel to slowly continue for several decades until they succeed. If they do manage to force out the Arabs they will have peace simply because they will not have any Palestinians under their rule.

&gt;Why should a colonised nation agree to its colonization, give up 55% of its territory and agree to have a large part of its population living under the rule of the invaders? This was the ""offer"" that was made to them. I would not have agreed to this, and neither would you. The fact that the foreign powers wanted to give their homeland to the invaders does not make their refusal unjustified and does not make their resistance illegitimate. No one else would have acted in any other way.

The key point here is the world ""nation"". Of coarse if you look at the region of Palestine as a nation then the offer is not logical or acceptable. However you must remember that the Palestinian people are not a distinct ethnic group, but are in fact ethnically Arabic. The treatment of the Palestinians as a unique ethnic group is a relatively recent development, considering that during the 70's Arafat himself stated multiple times that there is no such thing as Palestinian people.

If you consider the Palestinians as members of the Arab ethnicity the offer is very logical. The geographical territory of Israel is an absolutely tiny percentage of the Arab world. Israel doesn't contain almost any natural resources and is completely insignificant in the larger picture. However it is unquestionably extremely significant to members of the Jewish ethnic group. It is well known that Jews have wanted to rebuild a sovereign nation in the area of Israel for thousands of years. In fact one of the prayers said during Passover relates do the yearning of the Jews to return to Jerusalem.

I'm sure that the Palestinians felt attached to the land they where leaving on for years, however I'm sure that if they would not have reject every proposal outright and even refused to negotiate it would have been possible to come to a solution that would involve financial compensation for relocation, especially considering that the amount of people needing to relocate would not be very high and the Jewish settlements who ended up on the Palestinian part of the plan already agreed to relocate.

It is also quite hard to call the building of Israel colonization considering that the local population was never self governed through its entire history. In fact its quite clear that what happened was that a nation sold some of its territory to a group of people while maintaining sovereignty (The ottomans selling parts of the area to Jews), and when they lost sovereignty to another nation the new sovereign decided to split the area between the inhabitants. You must also remember that the British mandate was not limited only to the region of Palestine but included the entire are of modern day Jordan, so the percentage of the land given to the Jews was extremely small and no were near 55%.

Overall the Arabs were offered a very nice deal that could have been improved even further if they agreed to negotiate.

&gt;What you do not seem to get is that Israel's strength is not its own but is derived from the support it gets from other countries — mainly the US. Remove that and Israel will not retain its advantage for long. Even now, with Israel's growing isolation, its Mubarak-dependent ""peace"" treaty with Egypt teetering on the brink of collapse, its impending confrontation with Iran, and who knows what else, it is clear that Israel's military superiority is far from permanent. All it would take is for the US to abandon it and Israel will collapse like a house of cards. And then what?

If you consider Israels history you will see that while US support is very important, Israel has managed very well without significant American Support for many years. In fact US support of Israel was very small before the 1973 war, which means that Israel managed just fine and in fact very successful fought multiple wars against its neighbors without having any significant support from the US.

The main reason for US support in 1973 was the massive support given to Israel's enemies by the USSR. US doctrine at the time deemed it essential to protect every pro western country from soviet aggression and so started the significant support we see today. What lead to the piece treaty between Israel and Egypt and the massive amounts of US aid given to Egypt was the US attempt to sway Egypt from soviet sphere of control.

While the deterioration of Israel's relations with Egypt is unfortunate, the Egyptian army is even more reliant on US aid then Israel. Without foreign aid it is not even a close match to Israel's army.

Considering US public opinion and the statements given by US representatives I very much doubt US aid to Israel is going to be significantly hit.

Overall the situation of Israel is pretty good right now and while relations with its neighbors might deteriorate, it is not something Israel has not faced before and is probably ready for it. ",0,,worldnews,,t1_c3hvhic,2015-07-01 12:40:16.000000,,

It has a lower recreational abuse level and you often won't see people with tolerance excited over it. However, it is a very UNIQUE opiod. The reason it is being looked into for OCD treatments is because it has SNRI properties. SSRI and SNRI are a type of medication that are in anti-depressants and medicine for anxiety and a slew of other low-medium mental issues. As a result it is not surprising to see tramadol being used in OCD trials due to its SNRI qualities. You would not see other opiates in such trials.

Your benefit seems to be twofold. First and foremost any depression or anxiety you have is lifted by the mood-elevating properties of an opiate. Secondly, over time (it takes 3 weeks to begin working on average) the SNRI properties of tramadol have clearly helped your OCD in a way you might find similar to other SNRI medications. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitor)

From Tramadol Wiki:
&gt; Tramadol is also molecularly similar to venlafaxine (Effexor) and has similar SNRI effects, with antinociceptive effects also observed. It has been suggested that tramadol could be effective for alleviating symptoms of depression, anxiety, and phobias[6] because of its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its ""atypical"" opioid activity.[7] However, health professionals have not endorsed its use for these disorders,[8][9] claiming it may be used as a unique treatment (only when other treatments failed), and must be used under the control of a psychiatrist.[10][11]


As we see here Tramadol is similar to other SNRI medicines such as effexor. Now, the opiate action of tramadol is weak so a withdrawal would be like a bad cold or flu. HOWEVER, the SNRI withdrawal would be similar to an anti-depressant withdrawal. These two withdrawals combined could be very unpleasant and at worst cause seizures and suicidal thoughts.

I suggest you do research on this and educate your physician with properly sourced and researched journal documents. It may be necessary for you to begin another SNRI as you quit the tramadol so you only have to deal with one withdrawal at a time (the opiate withdrawal and then the SNRI withdrawal). Conversely, you might want to find an SNRI and stay on it since it seems to be helping your OCD traits.

Please let me know if you have any more questions. You are most certainly not doing long-term damage. But quitting a low-power opiate after 7 years isn't a big deal. But quitting an SNRI after 7 years can be a big deal. Your brain has adjusted drastically. I suggest working with a medical professional to help you through your withdrawals and potentially find another SNRI medication to take when you switch off of tramadol. Even if you quit that other medication after a couple months, it will let you only deal with one withdrawal at a time. However, I am NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. So PLEASE find a physician who is intelligent and able to advise you. Do not fuck around when it comes to your brain.


**The other posters at the time of my posting this have given incorrect and potentially dangerous medical advice by saying you have nothing to worry about since tramadol is a weak opiod. I strongly suggest, and personally find it irresponsible, to give advice when you are not educated on the pharmacology of a drug.**",0,,opiates,,t1_c3hxe0w,2015-07-01 12:39:38.000000,1970-01-01 01:00:01.000000,

Occupy Wall Street began as a small movement, relying mostly on social media to spread both ideas and information – the modern day word of mouth. The movement gained momentum quickly and bore no signs of losing it. In just a matter of weeks, it became clear that the movement was not going to fade anytime soon. Major news coverage lasted for months, and as each new development broke the movement only grew. But now, just 60 days after the Zucotti Park eviction, and less than a month after the eviction at City Hall in Los Angeles, the Occupy movement has lost its captive audience. We now find ourselves wading through the GOP debates, caucuses and primaries all without a breath about the significance of Occupy Wall Street and its affiliate movement.

It’s no secret that the public is fickle. As much as we would love to deny it, our political attention span is only slightly better than that of the average Tweeter. That which is deemed “breaking news” today may be forgotten within a week. Coverage only lasts as long as the topic remains relevant and current, and it is becoming clear that the Occupy movement has lost the currency of relevance.

The movement’s significance is fast disappearing, and it is now considered yester-year’s news. While the high-flown ideals are still intact, the revolutionary “force” is now gone. The media momentum that bolstered the movement so quickly back in September has vanished without so much as a parting wave. It is not that people have jumped off the bandwagon; the bandwagon has been derailed. Those not core to the movement have either lost interest, become disillusioned, or lost track of the movement as a whole. Occupy was never the most unified of movements, and now that its national voice has disappeared, so has the simulacrum of national unity. Originally, the movement’s strength was found in the fact that its message appealed to the masses – the 99% that it claimed to represent. Now that the coverage is gone, so is the movement’s potency. The movement continues, but the attention of the country has moved on.

A quick look at Occupy’s online content confirms the sneaking suspicion that the movement itself is under the misguided impression that it remains significant. An inspirationally video on occupyla.org asserts with confidence, “The end of the physical occupation was the beginning of the next phase of the people’s movement.” According to this ideal, the physical action of occupying sidewalks and squares was just the beginning of a much larger ideological movement – the ‘people’s movement’. In reality, the protestors occupying public space defined the movement. Now that they no longer have this option, protestors are left without an outlet for their ideologies. The video goes on to declare, “Occupy exists in the conscious awareness of the world, and in the global heart of the 99%.” Despite these bold claims, it requires no politically trained mind or miraculous foresight to predict that the Occupy movement has, for the most part, run its course. Talking heads are no longer discussing it, political candidates have never really addressed it, and most protestors have returned to their regular lives. Occupy has proven to be a fad; an illegitimate way of expressing legitimate political dissatisfaction. For better or for worse, the Occupy movement is dead.

The death of a movement may not be as sensational as the birth, but the end is just as definitive as the beginning. We can now move on, shaking the dust from our proverbially political sandals. Our only consolation, and really the only thing the Occupy movement proved, is that free speech remains intact, provided you don’t pitch a tent or build a tree house in front of City Hall.",0,,AskReddit,,t1_c3hyhdn,2015-07-01 12:39:22.000000,,

SRS doesn't live up to your expectation of what you think SRS should be. And that's fine. Maybe it makes you feel frustrated, maybe a little sad, and maybe a little confused as well.

Just remember that this is how minorities, women, transexuals, and gay people feel when *they* browse ""regular"" reddit.

I've seen women chased out of /r/2xc. I've seen black people called niggers in /r/askreddit. I've seen children oogled. I've seen people stalked and harrassed in [/r/aww](/r/aww) until they were forced to delete their account. None of these are outliers and more examples happen like clockwork.

SRS is quite literally the only safe place on reddit where being a minority won't get you shouted down, where being racist and sexist is not acceptable in the least, and where these people don't have to explain themselves to the people who don't get it over and over, and regain some pride that was taken from them by the people of reddit, and from the people in the real world.

Many people who are racist and sexist have zero drive to change that fact ... in fact refuse to. So I ask you this: why should SRS play by civil rules when that olive branch never extended to the members of SRS to begin with?

&gt; but it really disturbs me to see the depths that [SRS] is going towards

And it really disturbs *me* to see the depths that the reddit community tolerates and accepts juvenile bigotry. Until SRS gained steam, any attempt to address reddit's problems were shouted down immediately, never to see the light of day.

So, why derail, circlejerk, ban, and shout people down? Because they can. Because it shows the same level of respect that those same bigots never showed to SRS. Because SRS is not there to educate you. SRS is there to accept people who are already frustrated with reddit and it's general lack of empathy and acceptance.",0,,TheoryOfReddit,,t1_c3hyjb9,2015-07-01 12:39:19.000000,,

As far as the separation of church and state, He correctly states ""The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers. On the contrary, our Founders' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs. Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, both replete with references to God, would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion. The establishment clause of the First Amendment was simply intended to forbid the creation of an official state church like the Church of England, not to drive religion out of public life.""

If the temporary addition of these policies really can affect equality and correct social stigmas then they are more justifiable.  Though eventually the correction should occur and the policy should be repealed. However, this would be more conclusive if they followed up by looking at actual attainment.  Changing the attitude is good, but does that change actually do something?  You cannot rule out that there are other factors than past social inequality that will affect attainment in women in comparison to men.  My hypothesis would be that this change in attitude would result in greater attainment in women.

* The officer cannot tell them they are trespassing unless they have been asked to leave and have refused, as they were not asked to leave but were in fact told to stay by the owner they are not trespassing.

* The officer is not the owner of the property, he cannot ask someone to leave, the owner must, then the officer can enforce a trespass if the owner wishes.

After being told to scram the kids got up to leave, one of them laughed and smiled cause he is 13, they have a tendency to react like this in situations where they are scared or rather confused, it is a defensive mechanism.

The cop was wholly out of line and never stated what he was being arrested for.

Oh and FYI, until such time as you are asked to leave, or a sign is placed that being on the property without permission is trespassing, you are not trespassed.
We do not know if the property had a sign, the owner(?) never stated they were trespassing, and never asked them to leave.",0,,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,,t1_c3i4eqq,2015-07-01 12:37:49.000000,,

Yes, the primary problem being that marijuana is currently illegal

&gt;Most people who smoke it are just lazy stoners who have had their brains fried by the drug.

Citation needed, ad hominem, and no.

&gt;The truth is I know someone who had a panic attack on weed and almost died.

That's unfortunate. I know someone who got alcohol poisoning and did die. And someone who got drunk and killed himself and a family in another car. And someone who has panic attacks if she drinks. Funny how alcohol is legal. Of course, it was banned by constitutional amendment for a while, until people realized that those who wanted it could still get it and criminals were getting rich because of it.

&gt;Right now people are dying of marijuana overdose

I have to assume you are trolling or that this is satire and I'm missing the point. First, OD on marijuana is nigh impossible. Second, even if it were, it is at least as difficult as ODing on alcohol, which is legal. Therefore this is not a good argument against the legality of marijuana.

&gt;Like how about all the recorded deaths of weed? How do you excuse those numbers?

Assuming there are indeed recorded deaths, for which a citation would be nice, the same way all the recorded deaths of traffic accidents or alcohol overdose are justified. Banning it did not significantly decrease use or availability and caused many other problems. The good done by making it legal and regulated will either not increase deaths or will make up for it.

&gt;I'm just sick of seeing weed defended on these boards and I didn't expect to see it in this subreddit.

Since philosophy often extols the virtue of developing a knowledgeable opinion and submitting assumptions to high scrutiny, it should be no surprise that a social/legal norm is challenged in this subreddit. I honestly have a hard time believing anyone who has done historic and empiric research into the subject actually believes making marijuana illegal is actually an intellectually defensible position. If you contest that medical marijuana shouldn't be allowed, I think your position is both morally and intellectually indefensible.

&gt;Never expect to see it legalized.

Probably not soon. Perhaps it will be decriminalized. It's already effectively legal under CA law, so maybe you need to reevaluate the impossibility of the proposition.

To be clear, her conversion has more to do with marrying a Jew than this isolated incident where she was exposed to another culture, accepted it as equally valid, and shared a unique human experience.  I don't actually even know how theistic, if at all, said holocaust survivor was.   I'm not entirely sure of how theistic my sister is; of all the things we talk about I can't imagine who would even bring a thing like that up.

Aside from that, there are a significant number of secular Jews.  There are plenty of atheist Jews.  It is an ethnicity aside from a religion; one with many cultures represented as well.  I can't imagine her conversion doesn't also entail sociocultural factors.  She was raised theistic, and I assume - as is implied by conversion - that she's remained theistic.  So nothing about the harrowing experience she heard someone else talk about has had any bearing on her theistic state, which I'm assuming hasn't changed.

No one sane is going to dispute the observable reality that the balance of power favors rightsholders -- or, at least, wealthy ones -- far too heavily.

The entire concept of intellectual property as it exists today is predicated upon the assumption that *creativity is valuable*, and that to incentivize it we must protect it.

Clearly Megauploads was engaged in, while not direct piracy, turning its head away from blatant acts of piracy under its very nose. Megavideo is mostly pirated tv shows. And Icefilms, a very blatant pirate site, is very clearly linked to megauploads. The mere fact that icefilms has been mentioned in this thread shows something about the situation. The fact that an investigation led to an indictment shows that clearly this is serious business and there's probably/definitely some wrong doing that we're currently not privy to. So before everyone is like ""OMG GOVERNMENT Y U SUCK?!"", I think we need to step back and wait for the details. A federal indictment has to have facts to back it up.

Honest question, but didn't they? They boarded a ship in international waters and the situation escalated until they met resistance (armed with ""iron bars, dinner plates and knives""), resulting in the death of nine passengers and wounded on both sides. What did they expect? If nothing else, it was handled badly and Israel has directly refused to apologise.

[A UN report found](http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/middle_east/Gaza_Flotilla_Panel_Report.pdf)

&gt; The naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law.

&gt; Israeli Defense Forces personnel faced significant, organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers when they boarded the Mavi Marmara requiring them to use force for their own protection.

But:

&gt; Israel’s decision to board the vessels with such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone and with no final warning immediately prior to the boarding was excessive and unreasonable

&gt; The operation should have reassessed its options when the resistance to the initial boarding attempt became apparent.

&gt; No satisfactory explanation has been provided to the Panel by Israel for any of the nine deaths. Forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times, including in the back, or at close range has not been adequately accounted for in the material presented by Israel.

&gt; There was significant mistreatment of passengers by Israeli authorities after the take-over of the vessels had been completed through until their deportation. This included physical mistreatment, harassment and intimidation, unjustified confiscation of belongings and the denial of timely consular assistance.

In later raids on aid ships, mistreatment of passengers is a continuing theme.

I know reddit can be a bit over-the-top about demonising Israel, but I think there are some legitimate criticisms about how things are handled.

 Literally if 10,000 people do this, and the lawyers for these companies demand, lets underestimate it at $200 per hour. These cases will get settled quickly, so we can say 1 hour total per case. That's $2,000,000 right there, an that is assuming they're using cheap lawyers.

The above sum is JUST in legal fees.

People who were hosting website backups, valuable files or anything else economically viable have a 99% chance of getting a payout since them shutting down the website without the knowledge of the people could significantly harm many businesses.

So is the payouts range from $100 to $20,000 (least to most extreme), This could easily add another 2 or 3 million dollars to the total.

THEY'RE BROKE!

I'm floating around the 26 year old range. These girls either did it for their senior trip, during college breaks, or a after-graduation ""get to know myself"" thing. Want to know how they did it? They had help from the parents or they dipped into excess funds from their student loans they're now paying back.

So yes, they've gotten around...*snicker...but they're not going to be able to do it again for a long time unless they find some stable money. Do you think they'd be on a dating site if they were consistently wealthy enough to travel regularly? HELL NO!

But you can't blame them for wanting to show their adventurous side or that time they looked their absolute best in that shiny dress that night out with the girls in the city. Just keep in mind that's not an everyday thing. They say they want to again because DUHHH, it's fun as shit!

He clearly states that people with good connections are not throttled or deliberately disadvantaged in any way, and that ""host advantage"" was actually something that was added in past games to make up for the lag that hosts would experience due to the fact that they had to process more.  In other words, the very idea of instant hit detection for hosts is a myth in CoD's peer-to-peer networking.  There's a lot more going on here.

No facts were stated, and although plenty of things were implied, no conclusion was reached other than ""vote for this guy instead of that guy"".

Furthermore, his presentation is so obscure in purpose that it actually contradicts itself. ""What if every candidate was superficially different, but really the same"" he asks. ""What if the election system is just in place to give the illusion of choice and control?""

If you think through that on a level below the merely topical, you'll see that if the former is true, than Ron Paul must be (or at least *could* be) no different than every other candidate - making lofty promises that he has no intention of keeping once elected. And if the second is true, then voting for Ron Paul won't actually do anything anyway, since the voting system only gives the illusion of control, not control itself.

It's got the right pixel count and it seems to do as well as my D90 or better in low light.  I imagine that the rumored upcoming 36mp sensor will be cut from the same metaphorical wafer as this one, since this has a similar linear resolution.  The mage quality from the camera is definitely impressive, unless you like selective focus.  So it's great for tourism and landscapes and snapshots, which are what it's designed for, and probably ok for amateur sports since it's so forgiving.  But not for portraits.  It has the potential to be awesome for macro if they introduce that damn overdue adapter.

It's the controls that get me.  Just... not enough control or flexibility, at all.  For me to get a ""system"" benefit from a Nikon, it's got to take at least some of my existing glass (the F mount adapter is looking more like vaporware), or at least my expensive external flashes.  The J1/V1 presently use *none* of my existing gear.  And at least in my in-store play sessions, I couldn't find manual exposure options at all.  As a ""traditional"" photographer, I found most of the controls on the J/V to be meaningless.  I want my MASP, dammit!

I really hope that the next thing gets the rest of it right.  The sensor and mount don't have to be bad, they could certainly be assets in their own right.  Give me system compatibility in the form of an F-mount adapter and a CLS flash shoe or built-in commander mode.  Then price it out of the stratosphere.  Price it into impulse buy territory.  If this thing with the F adapter included (either in addition to a cheapo lens, or with no lenses) were priced alongside the 3100, I'd probably buy one as a supplement to my other gear.  But if it's going to cost me $1000 to be operational and still can't do any lighting fun, then I'll have to pass.

Edit: The adapter is now available, but costs half again as much as a J1 body.  So I'd be at $1100 for a V1 with an (unwanted) 10-30 lens and this adapter... may as well just buy a Nikon 2x teleconverter and a spare D90 for the same money.

The severity of the penalty, based upon the impact with the boards, shall be at the discretion of the Referee.

That play was textbook boarding, regardless of what the call on the ice was.

Continuing further, you'll see:

&gt;Any unnecessary contact with a player playing the puck on an obvious “icing” or “off-side” play which results in that player hitting or impacting the boards is “boarding” and must be penalized as such. In other instances where there is no contact with the boards, it should be treated as “charging.”

I just have to keep reminding myself that there are good officers out there, and it is unfortunate that the bad ones tarnish that image. The ones you really have to watch out for are the undercover cops. They are a well armed gang of thugs that hide behind a badge. Many times they look like gang bangers themselves and have their badges under their shirts but it doesn't matter if you are attacked by them because you can be a law abiding citizen and the judge will take their word over yours even if you were the victim.

The release of footage of cops behaving badly has been irking me. It bothers me most notably because I have trained certain police groups in the past on subduing a person without a taser or pepper spray and without excessive force. The tactics I have learned and imparted on to others are solid thanks to a long standing training relationship with my martial arts teacher that has instructed me since the age of 12.

Especially a story to note from when I was young is that my best friend at the time was jumped by a group of four FOB (Fresh of the Boat) members. I listened to the statement  my friend gave and then I went after them. The police never caught them but I did because of knowing the San Francisco terrain and the bus they took. Parents and parents of friends pleaded for me not to go as well as the police and I just told them I needed to go home (interview at friends house).

Moral of the story, it wasn't pretty when I caught up to them walking along the N MUNI line. It is also not easy to fight two people who are older than you than the two my age. They were never caught by police, but they were caught by me and this story is the main reason I believe cops should live in the jurisdiction they work, unfortunately they feel entitled to more because of the dangers of their jobs. A great majority of people have dangers in their job, I am one of them.

My campus doesn't allow knives so since I have been working there I don't carry one. It is discomforting to me that I can't carry a knife due to federal regulations and University policy, a felony really? Most of the time it is just a tool to open boxes and the like, no knife but a box cutter.

&gt; Would ban flag burning

Paul introduced two bills that would amend the constitution to allow the states to prohibit flag burning. He did this because any legislation that tried this without an amendment would be an unconstitutional prohibition of free expression. It was also in response to a lot of politicians blabbering about how it should be illegal to burn the flag. He was basically daring them to vote for the amendment, which they did not do. He did the same thing for the Iraq War. He's always claimed that war required a declaration, so he introduced an official declaration of war, which congress rejected. That doesn't mean he supported the war.

&gt;Believes in the concept of 'jury nullification', the idea that a jury can judge not only the facts in a case but the justness of the law itself

Jury nullification is a perfectly valid thing. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification#United_States))

""U.S. v. Moylan, 417 F.2d 1002 (4th Cir.1969), affirmed the right of jury nullification""

""United States v. Dougherty, 473 F.2d 1113, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling similar to Moylan that affirmed the de facto power of a jury to nullify the law but upheld the denial of the defense's chance to instruct the jury about the power to nullify""






The reason his supporters may appear to be annoying assholes is because they have to deal with crap like this (not from you, but the author of the article you linked).  It's one thing to argue over actual issues, but to claim he holds positions that he doesn't (flag burning) or to say he's crazy for believing in something that is real (jury nullification) is just sloppy and shows that you don't care about reality or raising the level of discourse.

Blink-182: My all-time favorite artist for many, many reasons. I suppose the main reason is growing up on their music. I can relate any mood/emotion that I've ever had to one of their songs. They also have one of the greatest drummers of all time, which defines most of their songs. I could rant about how great this band is for hours, but I'll just end this by saying that they have everything in their songs from relationships, the meaning of life, rebellion, and fun.

Rise Against: This is another artist that I can pick out a song for just about every situation. Although I don't exactly agree with all of their political views, their music is still my second favorite. Tim McIlrath's voice may sound scratchy, but in my opinion, it works perfectly with the music that they have. Every one of their songs has some sort of deep meaning in it, and they are all much more than entertainment.

A Day To Remember: Personally, I think this band perfectly mixes the genres of hardcore and pop-punk. They are one of the few artists have done this successfully, and my personal favorite of those who have. Their singer, Jeremy McKinnon can effortlessly go from singing to 'screaming,' and it sounds great.

+44: Although this artist has only release one album, it is one of the few albums in which I consider a perfect album. Their songs are incredibly relatable and can bring me to a state of relaxation.

We had been broken up for a couple months at that point but I had started the semester when she dumped me so I had to finish out the semester still living with her while we were broken up. Not a good time. I was going to school in the city of Chicago and life was good up until that point.

So, here I am living in my parents' basement, no girlfriend, not going to my school of choice anymore and just turned 21 so I became a pretty severe alcoholic.

When I had moved out my ex-girlfriend pulled the whole, ""I want to still be friends"" card and left the door open for communication, ""If you **ever** need **anything** call me or just come over. So one evening, while holding off the urge to drink, I call her. She doesn't pick up, so me being the emotionally unstable mess I am decide to just stop by for a visit. I still have keys (I was still paying for the apartment since I couldn't pull off the lease quite yet and I still had some stuff there). So I drive about an hour and a half to get to the apartment.

Walk in through the kitchen, meander over to the bedroom, open the door and flick on the light and she's sleeping in bed with her new boyfriend. I was unaware she was already seeing someone new. My heart sinks into my feet and I walk back out into the living room. He wakes up and wakes her up and she runs out of the apartment into the hallway upset. He goes out after her and I'm left standing in the living room wondering what to do now.

""Go to the kitchen and grab the biggest knife in the drawer next to the sink."" is the first thing that pops into my head. ""Bad idea, don't do that.."" I feel like I'm going to throw up, I walk over to the corner and grab a wastebasket, a condom wrapper is chilling on top of the garbage. I don't need to throw up anymore. I open the window, pop out the screen and light a cigarette. I'm halfway in and halfway out of the 3rd floor apartment with a cigarette in my mouth and I'm twirling my butterfly knife to keep my anxious hands busy.

Her boyfriend walks back in, ""Uhh... are you going to be alright? Because if you cause any problems..."" I snickered and flicked my cigarette out the window.

""You'll what?"" as I flip my knife closed and put it back in my pocket. ""I'm just gonna grab some of my shit and head out.""

I grab a bag and snag some of my stuff that I left in the closet, and proceed to head out. My ex-girlfriend is walking in as I'm leaving. ""Thanks for the most awkward night of my life, FappedInChurch."" I laugh at her and walk out of the apartment. Her boyfriend follows me out, ""I'm gonna have to ask for your keys so you don't come back and bother us.""

I responded, ""Y'know what? I'll give you the keys, just so I'm not tempted to come back and kill the two of you in your sleep."" I toss him the keys, ""Take care of her for me.""

I get outside to my car, put the keys in the ignition and start bawling. I get home in about 30 minutes, I floored it pretty much the whole way. I crawl into my bed and just stayed there all day crying.

tl;dr I met and found out about my exe's new boyfriend by awkwardly stumbling upon them sleeping. I then threatened them in a badass fashion as I walked out to my car and went home and cried like a bitch.",0,,AskReddit,,t1_c3jtgl6,2015-07-01 12:27:22.000000,,

While, yes, they should be allowed to recoup their investments, these acts they keep putting through only protect them, and their industry...it has other repercussions that could potentially kill independent musicians and movie makers by destroying all outside methods of distributing and showing independent works.  Thus, mission accomplished, the RIAA/MPAA keep control over who gets famous, and who gets to collect money for their work.

The RIAA is running scared because the technology today was inconceivable when they established their businesses.  I can compose, and record music professionally with less than $600 worth of equipment, and set up a distribution model and payment system...which puts the power back in the hands of the musicians rather than a few companies that had the specialized equipment and could control the flow....

MPAA is running scared because what can be done with today's technology would have been inconceivable 10-15 years ago.  I could create and distribute independent movies with less than $2,000 worth of equipment...sure, they might look primitive compared to what you see in the box office, but it is conceivable to create movies with similar special effects to the original Star Wars, and even some movies that were made through the 80s with what is available now.  Even CGI based movies can be produced on the home computers of today, some independent CGI films I have seen were produced by a single person, and had quality as good as Pixar or Dreamworks did 4-5 years ago.  These acts that the MPAA want, would destroy these independent film makers ability to show and distribute their works.

By regaining their control, they are regaining the control over how technology can be used, who can be famous, and how stuff gets distributed.  They want to keep the control of the medium, and retain their middleman status...which technology has completely eliminated the need for.",0,,worldnews,,t1_c3jy5xa,2015-07-01 12:26:51.000000,,

Personally, I can't answer your question here--at least not definitively. I don't know the answer. Though I do know that you are taking one verse extremely out of context and parsing together every other verse you can find about righteousness (also out of context), probably via a quick google search, and calling it an argument--and then somehow saying that this makes Paul unrighteous? Even **if** every other aspect of your argument were true, how could you come to that conclusion? At the very least it would mean that Paul was improperly quoting and repeating scriptures that say people are unrighteous.

I don't agree with what they did, but you're out and out wrong on this point.  Jurisdiction is, and always should be, based on where the crime took place.  If a Saud hires a hitman to kill a Canadian in Quebec, he should have to answer to the Canadian legal system, not the Saudi one.  If a Russian splinter group bombs Osaka, the Japanese legal system is the one at play.  And if massive Chinese cyber-terrorism hits Wall Street from Ireland, their crimes should damned well be prosecuted in New York.  Whether it actually will happen is a different story, but in this case the New Zealanders are our ally.

Just because you live in a foreign country does not mean you should not be held answerable to the laws of a nation in which you deliberately acted.  The alternative is a world like the United States before the FBI, where a bank robber could run from Texas to Oklahoma and the authorities could do nothing about it.

You have to separate reality from speech. On the IRS issue Ron Paul does not think it will be necessary as he wants to abolish the income tax and remove all of the tax shelters and loopholes. This makes the entire system far lass complicated and not require the massive oversight that is needed today. There will always be some government body to will oversee the collection of taxes, Ron Paul just wants to reduce it to about 1% of its current size. ""I want to simplify the tax code by taking it back to constitution approved levels and thus will be able to reduce or replace the IRS with an agency far smaller scale"" does not get the same crowd response as ""I am going to get rid of the IRS!"".

Same thing for the Fed. That is one of the things he wants to take back from private ownership and have the government responsible and accountable for the money and inflation policies. He wants to end the Fed, but he is not saying there should be no one should have authority over US currency.

The new testament bible is a book of bullshit mostly compiled/written by a guy with head trauma (Paul), several hundred years after the 'Jesus' character was to have died. The book is a collection of folk lore and stories passed down via word of mouth for many generations and it mutated over time.

The old testament is another collection of folk lore and stories that has been so heavily edited and revised that even between different translations the stories have drastically different meanings.

Religion is a tool both used and relied upon by people as a form of control and comfort. The problem is it is all bullshit that stands up to no historical scrutiny.

In the old testament, Moses leads this rebellion and mass exodus of Jews out of Egypt and goes out and lives in the desert for 40 years. Problem is the Egyptians only used black slaves and talk of them often, the Jews make zero mention, no revolts, no exodus, no loss of a huge portion of an army across the suddenly dry bottom of a lake split in two. The other problem is that an encampment that lasts 40 years tends to leave marks behind yet in the over two thousand years that people have been looking no such encampment has been found.

This judge, Garzón, has been always more interested in media than in Justice and has been always searching for cases in which he'd feel as a star.

The problem is, he's so concentrated in persecute Fame that he usually forgot the Law or simply he feels above Good and Evil.

Because this kind of behavior, Judge Garzón is facing 3 independent (meaning non-related) proceedings against him nowadays:

* For illegal wiretapping of conversations between lawyers and their clients.

* For prevarication and bribery, because he allegedly received money from a bank to exonerate the bank owner in a case (In a related issue he's prosecuted in USA also for a similar case by USA DoJ).

* And for the so called trial against Franco-era crimes.


About the third one, 'our star' perfectly know there's an amnesty in Spain, not only about right-wing crimes but about left-wing crimes as well.


Some years ago, some people tried to prosecute Santiago Carrillo (a well-known communist responsible for the massacre of thousands of people in Paracuellos del Jarama) and judge Garzón said that was impossible because it will be against Amnesty Law.


Interestingly enough his same legal arguments in that case are now against him because the Law is (and must be) impartial and not black or white just in case the respondent is a right-wing or left-wing member.


Furthermore, judge Garzón wasn't the competent judicial authority to learn about this case and the Spanish justice system warned him against violating the Law.


But Garzón wants the Fame and he proceeded maybe thinking he's untouchable.


Well, maybe he is not.

it explains a lot about his character.  even the ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" approach.  to date, while i've seen him say lots of dubious things, i've never really seen anything to make me doubt his intentions.  seriously, after spending so much time researching the U.S. government myself, i understand that trying to decipher what's going on involves basically using very difficult logical deductions to perform a psychological analysis of the ""conspirators.""  with the huge range of bizarre crap they're actually guilty of, it's easy to understand how people can go off the deep end, in trying to figure out their actual intentions (which is a big help in vetting evidence of some specific program).

  so Alex Jones, as far as i can tell, has just put himself in this position where he's cataloging all the information that comes his way, making predictions with a high rate of error, and those things, together with his appearance, and demeanor, make a lot of people doubt his credibility.

The thing is, all those dark sides that are so readily visible in those two cases apply to *all* areas of life. In truth, *nothing* should be done for profit, because everything you can think of that's being done for profit is being done very poorly in order to minimize ""cost"" and maximize ""profit"".

&gt; The cold hard fact is that when you shoot at a spotted target (in SC), a great majority of the time that target is not shooting back at you but at one of the ~4 other players shooting at him/her. You become complacent, and engage targets like a gigantic moron.

Sorry, but assuming that because someone plays the regular game, they are all trapped in a spam fest is a pretty big assumption.

So is the idea that you can only learn situational awareness from HC. I played HC for maybe 3 rounds total, but I've always used sound to locate enemies, looked for where health kit icons show up to locate hiding medics, and used the scream after grenades to find where they are hiding.

About the only thing I agree with you on is that 3D spotting forces you to learn to recognize portions of bodies sticking out. Distinguishing enemies doesn't make you any more accurate though. It just makes you shoot them sooner. Don't forget how much more important headshots are in regular compared to HC. If anything, I'd say playing without a 40% health penalty teaches you to aim BETTER.

**Post Text**: As you know, Minecraft is run using the Light-weight Java Game Library (LWJGL). We’ve been using a really old version of LWJGL because last time we tried to update it the game broke down and became unplayable for a lot of people. We are going to try to update it again once we release Minecraft 1.2.


However, the recent LWJGL version (2.8.3) includes a bunch of fixes for those of you who play with non-latin languages. If you want to try it out (to be able to chat in Japanese or Korean, for example), you should go to LWJGL’s download page and get lwjgl-2.8.3.zip (link for the lazy). In it you will find a folder called “jar” and a folder called “native.” Pick the files in those folders and replace the files located in your “.minecraft/bin” and “.minecraft/bin/natives” folders.

There are state laws about how much can be collected on toll roads and how toll roads must be a lower priority than lower use roads.  If the State of Indiana kept the toll road, it would not have been touched yet by construction workers.  This is in place to ensure the state doesn't spend a lot of money on toll roads only to leave non-toll roads damaged.

This is just an example of good intentions gone wrong.  It makes sense to want regular roads repaired first, but the law caused the toll roads to almost be completely ignored.

I agree with you 100% on IBM.  That was a huge screw-up that cost our state quite a bit of money.  This was a bit of the Republican line of thought that the private sector is always better than the public sector not working out.  Not all privatization is efficient, and this proved that.

When iPods first came out I wanted one *bad*, but it was insanely overpriced (over double what I paid for an Archos player) and the iPod was crippled to play just the codecs Jobs personally liked while my Archos played Ogg Vorbis, allowing me to store almost twice as many albums at cd-like quality.

Violent criminals don't (necessarily) deserve death. Especially extrajudicially. Just as the victim should not be criticized, the perp should not (automatically) be dehumanized. We don't know the circumstances that put him in that position. Maybe he was a really bad person, but maybe he was just desperate, or made a really bad decision under peer pressure ('cause we all know teenagers are level-headed reason machines).

Besides, violent criminals are not deterred by the risk of severe punishment or possible death during the crime. The existence (or non-existence) of the death penalty has no significant effect on murder rates. That would require the (potential) criminal to rationally weigh the risk before perpetrating the crime, and that really doesn't happen. Much of the research says the same for concealed-carry laws and violent crime; that there isn't much of a deterrent effect, if any.

So the ONLY benefit of this kid's death was that it stopped the crime, and *may* have prevented the old man's death. It would be better if it hadn't happened at all; that implicates both the criminals (choose not to perpetrate the crime), and potentially the victim (better situational awareness might have prevented the crime as well). What we have is a less than ideal outcome, that could have turned out worse. Period.

That's just not true. Nature breeds species with each other that are similar. If you insert genes from a different species into corn crops to make them more resilient against pesticides that has nothing to do with the natural process. The fact that somehow the lab manages to generate an organism that can survive is more of an elaborate coincidence. You keep maintaining that artificial GM and natural GM are the same thing.

How much money you earn doesn't really matter all that much, what matters is what you can buy. Playing with a stack of dollars isn't as fun as, say, playing with an xbox.

[Check out this page](http://www.zillow.com/blog/2007-02-20/smaller-families-living-in-larger-homes/). Basically, even though people might be earning similar amounts of dollars, they're able to enjoy much more lavish lifestyles. The value of an xbox360 in 1970 is practically impossible to quantify because of the vast amount of technology required to produce one. I would not be surprised if someone said that a single xbox360 has more computational power than every computer in 1970 combined. Yet you can get one for just a few hundred dollars.

There's also a lot to be said about the characteristics of various households income-wise. [Check this out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Household_Characteristics_and_Income.png). Basically, the richer you are, the more likely you are to have a full-time job, to have worked at least 50 weeks in the year, and to have 2+ income earners in your household. There's a drop-off at the very top end of the income spectrum for an interesting variety of reasons. For one, a lot of wealthy people are old and live off of income from their investments, which probably isn't counted as ""working"" even if it serves an important function in society. Secondly, as unlikely as it is for one person to be in the top 5% of income earners, it's even less likely that a single household will have 2 of them. If one person is fantastically rich, it's likely that his or her partner probably doesn't need to work.

Income is not a good measure of wealth, fulfillment or happiness, inflation-adjusted or not.

Feminism seeks to educate both men and women so that rape happens less often. Thus women benefit by being safer. Men benefit indirectly in that their wives, girlfriends, sisters, daughters, and mothers, are raped less often as well.

As many would bring up, rape is a men's issue as well. It has different causes, but it's also worth addressing. Men's rights people criticize feminism for ignoring men who are raped. As if it's the responsibility of feminism to also deal with men, which it's not, as they are separate issues.

Two hobos were walking down a farm road, and passing a farmhouse, when one of them spotted two pies cooling on an open window sill.

The first hobo says to the second, ""I'm gonna go ask to see if we can get one of those pies. You wait here, okay?"" The second hobo nods and waits out of sight, salivating at the thought of eating some pie.

The first hobo knocks on the door, which is soon answered by an ugly old lady. ""Ma'am, I spotted those pies on the window sill and was wondering if I could get one of them from you? I'll work for it, if need be."" The old lady responded with ""Follow me into the kitchen.""

Once they were both in the kitchen, the old lady said ""I haven't had a man in many years, since my husband passed away. I'll give you both of those pies if you'll have sex with me right here, right now."" The hobo thought about it while looking around. He spotted some ears of corn on the counter near the window and had an idea.

""Well, if you'll just turn around and bend over across the kitchen table, I'll take care of you,"" said the hobo. The old lady, excited as she was, complied instantly by pulling off her clothes and doing exactly as the hobo said.

The hobo reached behind his back, grabbed an ear of corn, shoved it in and serviced the old lady with it for at least 5 minutes. When he saw that the kernels were all soft and wet, he tossed it out the window. The old lady screamed ""More, more!""

The hobo grabbed another ear and another for the next 30 minutes. When the old lady indicated she was satisfied, she turned around and said ""Okay, I promised the pies to you. Go ahead and take them. Thank you for the pleasure of your company.""

The hobo grabbed the pies and headed out the door and found his friend near the window sill. ""Hey,"" he said, ""here are the pies. Let's go eat.""

Now that the Steam app is out of the way, let's start working on what I feel would be the greatest step for Steam: streaming.

I love the idea of OnLive, to be able to play a game from anywhere without re-installing it.  Sure, the resolution isn't optimal, but that's what you get with streaming at the moment.

But they've shown that it's possible to stream a game to other devices like Android phones and tablets.  And yes, I realize that you need a good internet connection to play the games, but it's a step in the right direction.

Now, my only problem with OnLive is that I already own a bazillion dollars worth of games on Steam so I'm not about to shell out more dough for the same games.  It would be amazing to stream Steam games from my own computer instead of a service like OnLive.

I realize that Steam and OnLive are currently two very different animals, but wouldn't it be great to splice their DNA, Dr. Mephisto style?

This is a pretty well put criticism that demonstrates that Paul is not a libertarian. He is a libertarian only to the point that states get full rights, not in a principled way.

As an example, while is is a libertarian when it comes to healthcare at the **federal level** (no government involvement, period), he supports (though does not endorse) the right of the states to have whatever form of healthcare they want, upto and including socialsied medicine.

People may try and deflect that by saying its just following the constitition. But he has supported attempts to repeal the 16th amendment and recognize the life of fetuses by amendment. Surely he would also support the most crucial libertarian principles at all levels of government through amendment?

In fact he has supported the 'we the people act' (google it) more times than any other piece of legislation. This would be unlibertarian as it would change the current system (where the federal courts enforce libertarian principles in limited areas such as privacy and freedom of speech) to one where states can ignore any constitutional provision stemming from the bill of rights. For a libertarian, along with the various perceived overreaches of the commerce clause over the past century, one of the greatest vicotires for libertarianism is the [incorporation of the bill of rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights) (please read that wikipedia link to understand how important it is). Paul's bill would prevent federal courts from implementing incorporation, which while a victory for states rights, is a loss for actual libertarianism.

Another good point. The total amount of gold on the planet is about 9 trillion dollars according to wikipedia. If we even allow for half of that to be minted and turned into 'competing currencies' it would fall well short of the roughly 17 trillion dollars that make up the US's monetary base. Unless a metal backed currency acheives at least a majority of use amongst spenders, its value will continue to be tied to the bulk of the base, which is fiat federal money.

The only way around this would either be:

* An unprecedented effort to create various forms of metal based currency to compete, which would cost a fortune as most previous metals (including gold) have economic purposes in computing, meaning the price would be disruptive and prone to speculation.

* A government mandated fiat deflation of the value of gold, which would be completely at odds with Paul's principles, and would results in two identical households separated only by one's penchant for gold jewellery suddenly seeing a huge non-productive change in wealth.

The sensible approach for Paul to take would be to promise to regulate the Fed so it **emulates** a gold standard, because an actual gold standard would be impossible; the US economy is worth more than all the gold in the world.

He opposes stem cell funding, and (from his answers at the debate last night) would do away with non-security funding for NASA.

His answer is that the private market would deal with it, but while true to space and other existing industries, it doesn't deal with the point that science funding creates new industries that the private sector isn't even aware of, because at its inception there is simply no commercial demand for it.

But if one were to take a simplistic view, forget all other factors, and just look at the extroversion-IQ correlation, one would conclude extroverts were smarter.

They are Social Democratic parties. Social Democracy is about achieving goals in wealth redistribution within the capitalist system. The welfare states that Western Europe's Social Democratic parties built were financed by export-led growth in many cases. The welfare of these nations therefore rested fundamentally on the sale of goods to others, the very core of capitalism.

Socialism also refers to the common ownership of the means of production. This is not a feature of European economies as it is business which produces and state ownership is confined to the likes of healthcare. Socialism does entail the central management of the economy by the state. Right-wing commentators succeed because they are able to convince dumb people that social democracy is socialism, and that thereby wealth redistribution is a way to diminish capitalism.

This is in fact wrong as wealth redistribution is actually a method of strengthening capitalism. This was the classic bargain of post-war Europe where workers ""accepted"" capitalism and eschewed socialism because they realised would benefit hugely from a capitalist system where wealth was redistributed more evenly. The welfare state and social democracy rescued capitalism from the brink, by repackaging it and presenting it in a way which would be acceptable to workers who had long since lost their tolerance for the laissez-faire model. Old fears of unemployment or no healthcare etc. were assuaged by a redistributive capitalist system capable of mitigating them while it improved massively the material standard of living.

Social Democracy created the Social Market Economy. A market economy, in any form, is an expression of capitalism.

By thinking that redistributing wealth is necessarily a socialist thing, you lend credence to what the right-wing commentators say. They brand the creation of a fairer society as socialist, when in actual fact it is the wholehearted participation in a capitalist world economy which has financed the creation of these fairer, more equitable societies behind which no socialist agenda lies (quite the opposite as we saw above, a fairer distribution of wealth in society was what *saved* European capitalism). Perhaps the agenda is a good society, but a good society cannot simply be named socialist because it is good.

To take further examples, the likes of free university is justified as a method of increasing the human capital of a particular European nation, so that our populations have the knowledge and expertise needed to COMPETE and to INNOVATE and to in other words effectively continue to engage in the capitalist world economy so as to perpetuate the wealth we have achieved. These policies you refer to as socialist are in fact championed as a method to strengthen a nation's own social market economy and its participation in a capitalist international economy.

Redistributing wealth is redistributing wealth. To label it socialism when it is in fact the cornerstone of the social *market* economy is dangerous and plays into the hands of the enemies of wealth redistribution. Whether unfortunate or not, socialism is a dirty word and should not be used to decribe the success of European **capitalism**. Redistributing wealth may be an aspect of socialism, but it should also be (and is) an aspect of capitalism, and the very key to the historical rescue of capitalism in post-war Western Europe.

Can you explain to me if Seedorf is perceived as ""that negro who missed a penalty"" why without any experience or universaity degrees he is talked about as the next general director of Holland's most prestigious club, namley Ajax: [Proof](http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=142060). Seedorf is thought back as that cocky **person**  who missed a penalty. His role is out played at the Dutch NT but all doors are open for him to come back. People love him on the human level, but in the NT his influence was not good for the up an comers like Sneijder, Robben, van der Vaart and RVP. It was time to move on and every person supporting a team, knows that sometimes means you have to say goodbye to certain players that carry a lot of aura like Seedorf does. They carry to much of the old team culture you want to brake away from and have so much charisma that new patterns of hierarchy would not start to configure with him in the team, while that was necessary for new elan and the new generation to really grow and take responsibility.

Kluivert? Referred to as somebody who caused 1 deaths and 1 severely injured? Well sometimes. You know why? because he actually did kill 1 man (the director of an theater) and nearly his wife driving as an idiot in a far to populated area with far to narrow roads who had kids and family you know. Witnesses have seen his tire come of the road, the police tried to repeat it, but stopped the experiment as they deemed not safe anymore for the specialist. That level of crazyness we are talking about. However they set the speed on 89,2 km an hour where he was allowed to drive 50. What did he get? 240 hours of social labor? Are you kidding me and he never even took the effort to really call the family who were left behind and only had one talk with them with his lawyer next to him. real compassion would probably distract him to much from his jet set lifestyle. The women also lost her job and could never work again. That family was also huge Dutch NT fans and could not watch the games anymore as he played in it and he never ever showed any real remorse. Kluivert is now head coach of the Twente youth. When he was at NEC and Björn Vleminckx  started to score a lot, he was linked with his improvement immediately. He himself was like guys, easy, but the media immediately labeled him with the success. He was offered commentary jobs on Eredivisie live despite not being a great commentator.

Davids. despite not having any significant education or having proved himself as trainer he was appointed in the board of directors at Ajax at a very young age. All hate went to ten Have, but eventually we could not walk around it, could we? Davids was the one that made contact with van Gaal and he was the guy that put the plan to set the club in fire in action. Going behind Cruyff's back and brought 4 months later a quote in the media for a character assassination on Cruyff. He held on to the race card like a pro and cashed it in when it was a strategic moment to do so. Davids was actually appointed because he was black. Positive discrimination. He knew that, but when Cruyff mentioned that when there was a heated debate it was racism all of the sudden. Cruyff was busy setting up the organisation as he did previously at Ajax that won them the Uefa Cup and later even van Gaal winning the CL benefiting from what Cruyff left behind. Cruyff went to Barcelona and also put his philosophy into action there with great success to this day as a result. Why does Davids think he knows better than Cruyff? Cruyff actually has a track record you know. He also talked behind Bergkamp's back how he did things wrong, instead of just going to him and talk about how he would like to see things happen. The guy gets critique because of the things he does, but why look in the mirror when it is far more easy to just pull out the race card when people call you out for what you do?

Now van Persie made me laugh. If there is somebody who has received critique after the WC it is him. Every time pundits say he is failing for the NT. You can't live in the Netherlands as that is the first thing you hear when you turn on the TV. Before this period he was at Feyenoord and was deemed as a disrespectful guy especially because he came just from the youth and took that free kick instead of van Hooijdonk who made Feyenoord UEFA champions that way. Remember that? If you want to go that far and you obviously want to go that far looking at you reaction, what skin color had van Hooijdonk? RVP was chosen as talent of the year, but was found unworkable. Arsene Wenger has made him calm but also Bergkamp and Henry as RVP's problem was that he thought he was the best at Feyenoord, which he probably was. He didn't see anybody doing things he couldn't do. When he came to Arsenal and saw those two players, he realized he had to learn a lot and got into ""learn mode"" instead of ""I should be the center of the team, because I am the best mode"". But he also had a big incident with a girl and was put into jail after allegations of rape. That received quite some attention despite not found guilty. It's funny you want to let that work against him, while he was found not guilty. You remember Kluivert was also accused of rape? remember that? Probably not, because nobody talks about it anymore, yet with RVP it should work stigmatizing and the fact it is less so is prove of racism, while the huge allegations against Kluivert didn't work that way either but that fact you don't even mention. That's selective and you can't have it both ways.

If there is any positive talk about him at Arsenal (people follow Eredivisie and their club first and foremost so what are you talking about) it's because of NT fans are being pro him and contra Huntelaar. Huntelaar is rapidly becoming a major force in Germany at Schalke, however has a totally different style than RVP and the Dutch NT would have to play totally different. He is far more a poacher and also if we look at stats more effective for the NT than RVP. So to compensate for that they will maybe bring up how important he is for Arsenal and how he could also play that role for Holland if we would configure a system around him that would make it work with him. He just is as an overall footballer better than Huntelaar and Dutch people love all round players like ..... Kluivert who is the all time top scorer for the Dutch NT and that stat is put out every time they can. It's funny that Kluivert never scored for his clubs so much and despite Roy Makaay becoming top scorer in Spain, made Deportiva champion and was big at Bayern, it was Kluivert that was totally unquestioned. Makaay white, Kluivert black. Where is your racism now?

If you look at the current NT, there is not a bunch of bigger friends. The whole nation fell over Nigel de Jong, but who defended him? Van der Vaart. Babel, Elia, Braafheid, Wijnaldum. You have seen how Sneijder jumped around Wijnaldums neck when he scored against San Marino? I have no idea how you can put out the things you said. The Dutch NT at this moment is the international example of how group with different back ground can be a bunch of friends fighting for each other and the trouble of the past was certainly not the one sided story you want people to believe in. Au contraire.

A sexless robot brings more to the table now. Robots, porn, and my gal friends... why do I need a man again?

Modern legal marriage is nothing more than a welfare program for men.

Masculism attacks stable, loving romantic relationships between women and men by increasing the fear of false rape claims, false domestic violence claims, slavery through child support and robbery through divorce.

Men don't want to be engineers that's why there are so few. It's too hard. It's a lot easier doing the ""hardest job in the world"", you know, be a dad and living off your wife.

Sluts are to men what scabs are to unions. They break the cartel they have over sex, meaning men have to lower their price from gold, diamonds and a virgin sacrifice.

We all know how this works - anything you say about men that isn't a complement is taken as misandry and misandry is supporting rape culture and therefore you are basically out there raping men.

Find a rich woman. Rape her/impregnate yourself with her semen. Sue her for child support. Profit.

I honestly think that Ayatollah Khomeini was less insane than modern Western Men.

Falling into the rapist category just gets easier and easier every day.

All a man has to do is claim abuse, and he can literally get away with murder.

If he stole semen from a condom, that's 100% his decision, and he should be 100% responsible for that.

Child support and alimony are the new slavery.

I guess the tl;dr of this is that China's legal system is more sane than any country in the west.

Battered Man Syndrome, the legal name of the pussy pass.

Why don't these ticking biological clocks find a decent woman? He's looking at women, not as humans, but as natural resources to be exploited by the CEO of Vagina Incorporated.

Yes, femocracy. The builders, armies, bodyguards, providers, and packmules of society are giving y'all a big middle finger. I think it's about time you shrews MAN UP.

One might almost think that perhaps males aren't the geniuses of the human race after all.

A much more accurate rape analogy: If you were drunk and driving, you would be arrested, but since you were just drunk and stupid, you're a poor helpless victim.

Men are keen to assert all of the benefits that modern society affords them, but at the same time quick to twist their hair into pigtails and play the 'I'm just a boy.'

Never trust a man. When you are out and they are around, go the other way. Your life may actually depend on you crossing the street or not taking that elevator.

Maybe he is on the rag or maybe all masculists really do hate women but simply hate women to varying degrees.
Masculists don't even think of women as human.

These masculist nut cases have only one goal: total male supremacy at the expense of women. Fuck every last one of these haggard harpies.

Masculists are trying to systematically destroy females and femininity and femaleness through their ever evolving system of ideological social engineering.

Masculism is the name for the gender equality movement, White Power is the name for the racial equality movement.

With the standards for 'rape' as low as they are, it's nearly impossible for a gal to get it right.

Yeah, I do.  I talked to these controversies in my original post.  Rose was cleared ***twice*** by the NCAA.  I don't care after that point, what they did to him was ridiculous.  And I seriously do not believe Cal was involved in any way in an agent buying Camby hookers.  Cal is not the kind of guy that would legitimately be okay with getting a player hookers.

Both of these instances are dubious at best as to Calipari's involvement, and the NCAA has themselves said Calipari was not at fault at all.  I'm not naive enough to think that that makes it true, but I honestly think Cal's involvement in the Camby incident was passing knowledge at best.

Davis' recruitment issues are rumors at this point started because of Calipari's previous incidents.  Nothing fishy happened.  He doesn't need to play dirty to get the best kids possible to UK because we are UK and his coaching speaks for itself.

EDIT:  Oh, and [Corey Maggette admitted to being paid before coming to Duke](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/07/11/sports/main214287.shtml) only after he had left and the NCAA did nothing about it.  Every coach gets involved with it.

I don't even think the hero is that strong in dota, tbh, but it has one significant strength that blood hunter doesn't have; when he ruptures a blinking hero, the hero still takes dmg for the distance of the blink, which, I believe, isn't the same as blood hunter (haven't played HoN in forever because S2 is terrible at balancing, but that's how I remember it working). This alone allows blood seeker to counter retardedly annoying heroes such as Anti Mage.

I know you can silence to prevent the blink, but the range on rupture is so much higher than the range on silence that, in HoN, you have to sneak up close and silence/ult at the same time, whereas in dota, you can just ult from far away, knowing they can't blink away, else take a ton of damage.

**Edit:** Since I hadn't finished reading your article, didn't get to the part about void. I would argue that the 1 second difference in ult at level 6 isn't a *huge* difference; I think the biggest problem w/ chronos in HoN is the pool of heroes. Anybody and everybody knows how retarded S2 heroes are, and a squishy like chronos just isn't viable when the pool contains 6800 heroes w/ blinks and bursts that can jump you and instagib you. As mentioned earlier, S2 is absurdly bad at balancing, and, when they introduced new heroes with a million and one different types of utility, they failed to buff old existing heroes, so now they are just completely nonviable (it's not just chronos, look at other auto-attack melee carries that used to be viable, way back in... umm... beta? tdl, scout, etc.).

In the current dota 2 pool, there aren't many heroes early game that can jump void and kill him before he has time to time walk away, whereas in hon, heroes have ingrained ridiculous bursts and blinks (midas???).",0,,DotA2,,t1_c3lodmu,2015-07-01 12:09:51.000000,1970-01-01 01:00:01.000000,

I really did feel bad for her, but not because I wouldn't accept the paper: I felt bad that that one little mistake was so devastating to her. I mean, I really think she thought that having that one bad grade would lead to a failure in the course, which would keep her out of college, which would ruin her career prospects, etc. etc. She needed to be really reassured that it wasn't a personal thing or a moral thing; it was a mistake, and all she needed to do was not do it again and she'd be fine.

There are many facets to this *lesson*. The one I would garner is that bureaucrats are unhelpful and find it unacceptable that being human means being careless or making mistakes. A better lesson that could be taught is that you can be accepting and be helpful, that you don't have to kick someone when they're down. I've heard the fairness argument over and over again, but as a student I couldn't give a shit, nor could my peers. Having TA'd in university multiple times, it matters little to me if work was handed in late, since I'd rather students actually complete the work rather than not, since they might actually benefit from having completed it later in their career. Additionally all students are not equal, some take on more burden than others, some have it easy, some have hidden disabilities, etc.; I've find late work acceptable up until the day it's graded and returned, without penalty (assuming I have full autonomy over assignments and projects, which is usually the case).

Show me a single Hindu spin-doctor who is trying to make the interpretation of Gita accessible to common man. When you tell them you read the English translation of it, they brush it off. No, all of them say, ""You have to learn Sanskrit first. Then you have read them all. Only then you will understand the truth"". Also, there is another reason. There is no single interpretation of these texts. Truth be told, they are man-made. And like any other ancient man-made texts, they have been subjected to revisions leading to several logical contradictions. There are many schools-of-thought within Hinduism itself based on the interpretation by the Leader of the school. What do we make of the ""TRUTH"" then?

By the time they start searching for it, TRUTH has given up and gone to the bar to have a pint.""

Some gay people are like Kurt, but a great deal aren't. There is a lack of role models or representations for gay people who are not as overtly flamboyant or camp as Kurt for those people who, when struggling with their sexual orientation and identity are faced with a limited and restricted portrayal of what it is to be a gay man. That itself is damaging because a gay person who does not see anything of themselves in Kurts portrayal can feel that they will not be accepted by or fit in with the gay community, or that coming out as gay will require them to change to more closely resemble the camp stereotype.

But the whole argument is pointless, would Argentina be stupid enough to attack ""just an Island"" with the threat of nuclear retaliation? Probably not. If they did it would be the stupidest thing a country could do. The chances are that the deterrence would save more lives in the long run.

What Argentina is doing is an attack. They have made clear that if we don't defend the Islands they will take them by force. So we must expend a significant amount on their defence.

Your producers still aren't impacted, but your wage costs are now $2000 daily, meaning the business now costs you $500/day to run.  Suddenly 21 people are out of work (10 producers, 10 sellers and yourself).

To apply this idea to your current job, imagine minimum wage were $100/hr.  How much longer do you think your company could operate?  Think you'd still be employed?",0,,politics,,t1_c3m2cy4,2015-07-01 12:05:03.000000,,

Otherwise, there are plenty of supplementary materials to be found online. I don't have the links with me currently, but I have a collection of errata, additional exercises, and a companion guide at home. In addition, some other texts offer good supplementary material. For example, the closure of a set B is defined as the smallest closed set that contains B. This is equivalent to saying that the closure of a set B is defined as the intersection of all the closed sets containing B. While this may seem obvious, some texts define it either way. This type of discrepancy can be alleviated by examining multiple texts.

Some other advice is to explore the topics in greater depth. Don't take the Dedekind cut construction of the reals for granted. Read the section and understand it. Take time to understand the Cauchy sequence definition as well. Both have their uses. This further exploration will make Real Analysis worth the time that you spend.

With most undergraduate math classes, you will only skim the surface. Use the class as an example of HOW to study a topic not WHAT to study. The material you cover should be a bare minimum. Take time to delve into the facets of the subject that most interest you. After you truly understand Rudin and what is behind it, you will be prepared to delve into graduate level maths where you can really get into the nitty gritty.

Regardless of the time that you spend, Real Analysis is a rite of passage for any undergrad. Enjoy one of the more fascinating and fruitful courses of your education! I will send you the links later!

and i do know people who are upset with their circumcision.  the reason you think you don't know them is that a male's sexual capacity is supposed to be unassailable, so it's not particularly common to just come right out and say that your dick is in some way broken.

So, given an apparent belief that Jesus was a complete fabrication, who do you think wrote the parables, and why do you think it's more likely that they were told by a story writer as opposed to a preacher names Jesus?

To me, the simplest explanation is that there was a preacher.  His name was Jesus.  He preached parables.  His works were exaggerated in the verbal record  over the next century or so.  Doesn't mean I think he did exist, but I can't state that he didn't with any level of certainty.

What I mean is that there's no reason he or anyone else would have mentioned every claimant at the time.  There were most likely some completely unremarkable messiah claimants that have had no mention in the historical record.

You seem to have missed the subtle notes in my comments about those who have significantly expressed physical traits resulting from their hormones.  There is far more crossover then you are allowing for and it has nothing to do with gender expression but physical form.  There is a huge segment of the population that is not so different.  There are women with legs that could easily be mistaken for men's because of what men's legs are predominantly thought to look like, and many men that have legs that could easily be thought to be women's because of what women's legs are believed to look like, etc.   A round ass can be present on a male or female equally.  Some men have something of an hourglass figure and if they wore clothes that were contoured would not be indistinguishable from similarly sized females.  Again, there is much more crossover, and grooming, fashion, epillation and prosthetics are ubiquitous in forming an amplified, false image of what female bodies are.

The fact of the matter is that many, many people, if you remove the context of the rest of their body and single out a particular non-genital body part, could be mistaken for the opposite sex that they are.  Did you know that many of the legs used in hosiery advertisements are that of male models?

HI,

Not too sure where to start but I'm a 24 year old male with a VERY humiliating problem (at least to me). My PENIS farts. This is what my latest girlfriend called it. Although she says it's the cutest and sexiest thing she's ever seen, I cant begin to express how embarrassing this is to me.

It can be anything from a soft wet whistling sound to a very loud popping or air escaping quickly sound. Yes, just like regular fart but much higher pitched and can be about 5x as loud. (coming out of a smaller hole, I guess). During a typical hand job my PENIS can fart up to 30 times. My girlfriend seems to love it but I feel like crying. The gentlest squeeze especially at the base can elicit a fart but the worst is when I orgasm.

This is not a health issue as I've been doing this all me life. It doesn't hurt, in fact the vibrations alone can initiate an orgasm. Just humiliating. Most women don't say anything, some laugh but every girl who has witnessed this seems to be mesmerized by it.

I know women like confident men but I just cannot seem to get comfortable with this and I feel it is ruining my life. Girls talk and I feel like the talk of the town. High school was a nightmare.

My question is: Are my the only one. Has anyone else experienced this? I've checked books, done internet searches etc., but can't find anything related to my problem. I don't feel that I can cure the problem but how can I be more comfortable with it.

How would you feel if you met a man who was attractive, kind, sensitive and sincere but PENIS farted?

Sorry if I was being too graphic but I felt like I finally needed a woman's opinion.

Thank you for your help and concern. Best Wishes

I ride a motorcycle and think the comparison is actually quite valid which I why I made the motor accident comparison. By all legal definitions I am an equal member of the road. I have the same rights, responsibilities and all of that the same as any other car. But I would be a fool to actually believe that is reality. I'm not equal, I'm smaller and people don't respect my rights.

Those who ride bicycles and whatnot also know the same aggravation. I have people cut me off all the time, violate my rights, and someone has actively tried to kill me in a road rage incident. There's really nothing I can do about it either other than push for more awareness.

It doesn't matter if someone pulls out in front of me and they're found at fault. That slight fender bender can mean I'm dead. Me being alive is more important than be right. Whenever you watch accident videos on motorcycle blogs and websites, its usually ""Yeah the cager was a dick and at fault, but you should have avoided that. See how in the video his wheels start to move, and you were in the blind spot due to the  semi."" Etc... etc.... There's a culture of promoting safety and awareness and trying to prevent accidents through teaching mistakes made by the victim.

But that idea offends people because we're in a culture that is supposed to respect everyone and be ""equal"".

You guys can listen to the same music, workout together, play video games together, even live together because you're so close. You can't help it but be annoyed by that voice, but that doesn't mean you make fun of it, or that you don't like him as a person. Tough luck, you don't like his voice. His feelings may be hurt, sure.

1) Men should have the right to say ""I don't want this child"" within a certain period of time after first learning of the child's existence. For example, if the woman tells the man about the child 3 months into the pregnancy, the man should have the right to think for a week. If the woman tells the man when the child is already born but she didn't tell him before, he should also have a week to think. If the man decides to say that, his parental rights and obligations to the child get revoked, but the woman can still go on with the pregnancy if she wants. This doesn't put well-meaning women in danger, because they can always tell their partner early and abort if he runs. Also this ensures that the woman can always say to the man ""hey, you're the one who wanted this kid"".

2) Paternity testing at birth should be mandatory for everyone with no opt-outs. If paternity testing tells the man that he's not the father and the woman lied to him, he should have the same right as in 1). This doesn't put well-meaning women in danger, because they don't lie about paternity, and doesn't make them think their husbands distrust them, because testing is mandatory.

The implosion-type of bomb works by compression the fissionable material until it reaches critical mass, where the object becomes super-dense and fission would begin to occur, meaning that the heavier elements would have components ripped from them to create lighter elements, resulting in the powerful ""blast"" that is associated with any nuclear device. This process would work with or without oxygen, as the reaction is purely on the atomic level. Once the plutonium core reaches critical mass, the splitting atoms would release their energy and explode outward.

The gun-type device operates exactly as it sounds: a ""bullet"" of uranium 235 is fired at a sphere of the same material, initiating the fission reaction. Again, it's the fusion reaction that creates the blast, and not oxygen in the air.

The only part oxygen plays is the blast wave. Any detonation that occurs in a volume of gas will INCREASE the blast wave, but a vacuum will not eliminate it.

If the theory that a nuclear device would not produce a ""blast"" in vacuum were true, we would not have stars. Remember that a star is little more than a super-sized nuclear fusion device. Their cores are super-dense, and lighter elements continually fuse together to make heavier ones (the opposite of fission). Any left-over particles are then emitted as radiation and the newly-created heavy elements are then pulled into the core of the star until it, too, becomes super-dense and implodes on itself, resulting in a nova or a super-nova, depending upon the initial size and makeup of said star.",0,,askscience,,t1_c3mv9m3,2015-07-01 11:57:36.000000,,

The finding is that as a scientist's field is closer to the speciality of climate change, the more likely they are to accept that global temperatures have risen and that human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures.

The 79 individuals were the most specialised in global warming. They listed climate science as their area of expertise, and they were actively publishing papers, more than half of their recent papers being on the subject of climate change.

That is to say the ones that were, at the time, climate scientists.

79 is a small sample according to some measures, but it is certainly enough to be able to make claims about the population of climate scientists. The standard error is (p(1-p)/n)^(0.5), which is ((.97)(1-.97)/79)^.5 = 0.02

Only feminists say that because feminists hate men and need to come up with an excuse for sex segregation so they can cut off male victims from any help.  It's disgusting and despicable behaviour.  You're as bad as the people who fought for racial segregation.

You're now shown to be nothing but a filthy liar and a rape apologist.  The interesting thing is you appear to be entirely representative of feminism at its best in that regard.  Where are the feminists who say it doesn't matter what sex you are if you're raped?  Nowhere.  Where are the feminists who refuse to lie?  Nowhere.

And here you are projecting your disgusting attitude onto the poor MRA guys.  A feminist posted the original article and a feminist posted this one.

Also, the game has 8 storylines. If you're finished with one, play another. The gripe about how 'nothing is new' is also really kind of baseless and pointless. SWTOR does what MMO's do and have always done. It's not a shooter, or an RTS, it's an MMO, and guess what? It does innovate. The attention to story, voice acting, and cinematics are all new to the genre.

The 'I'm a veteran' elitism is also pretty ridiculos. Endgame, and 'balance' (which pretty much no mmo has), are things that happen over time. WoW released with VERY limited endgame content. So did EQ. So did FF-11.

This game has plenty of new/interesting, and 'purpose' you have to find for yourself. That's such a general statement that I don't even know how you came up with it.

Anyhow, the game doing poorly won't help companies innovate. They'll blame it on the games innovations (like they always do), and go back to just making true WoW clones instead of games that try a few key things differently.

People said the same thing about the woman my brother-in-law married, she was nice blah blah blah right up until they got married.  The day before the wedding I told my wife they would seperate in 6 months because she was an awful person, they did.  She indeed did seem ""nice"", but to me she was clearly a fucking asshole, I based this on a few experiences:

1. She ordered haddock in a restaurant and sent it back because it was ""too fishy"".
2. She wore a wig sometimes for no reason.
3. We bought tickets for the four of us to go see Spamalot and she said she didn't like Monty Python but she'd go if she could bring a book with a light on it.
4. She constantly talked about her parents being dead.
5. She once ordered lobster at market price and only had $20 on her.
6. She bought a house while she was in college.

People gave her the benefit of the doubt but it was clear to me that she was a borderline sociopath.  She simply had no ability or care to consider how her words and actions appeared/affected other people.  Aside from these instances she was mostly normal but it was really clear to me that she was trying very very hard to seem friendly.

Firstly it is hardly surprising that GP's are against reform, my local surgery is open 30 hours a week, slow and buerocratic and have a pretty poor service, whilst my GP takes over 100k a year with a final salary pension. Do you really expect them to vote for a bill which makes them have to compete and do more work.

As long as it remains free at point of use I have no problem with private providers being able to compete and provide healthcare. If they were, I'm pretty sure GP's could wipe out vast overheads and provide a personalised home to home visit service for example, working remotely, this is the same for many other services and something many people would prefer.

Secondly if there is competition and easy entry in the market for providers, the amount they can profit will be limited as customers will only use the best rated services and as a free service the successes will be the companies who make best use of the money provided and create efficiencies (not just take as much profit as they can).

Thirdly it will allow providers to manage their staff for maximum benefit to the user. For example they can provide specialists for very specific things, such as heart surgeons that operate the same procedures everyday or clinical psychologists specialising in very specific areas ect. This is not the case for at the moment unless you live in London.

Fourthly the NHS has to adapt, it's just not possible to keep going the way that it is. The country has some warped perspective about it being a perfect system, it isn't, it's expensive (1/6 of all tax receipts), poorly ranked in comparison to many other European countries that have introduced competition and lacks innovation and choice. I hate the way that everyone compares this bill to moving towards U.S healthcare when its actually more like moving towards European healthcare systems such as France and Germany, which happen to have some of the best outcome figures in the world.

Bring on the down votes. I'm not sure the bill proposed is perfect and some key areas need protection, but the left wing media and Labour twist the argument so far that it becomes hysterical hyperbole to the point where people don't even discuss it properly.

1. Hell exists and is a place of great and never-ending suffering.
2. In order to avoid hell, people must submit themselves to God's will and accept Christ as their savior.
3. Any reasonable and loving person, if they loved another, would not want the person they love to go to hell.
4. Ergo, a Christian (a person, who believers points 1 and 2 above) who loves another person would certainly want that person to be exposed to Christ and his message, so as to prevent them from suffering.

I don't know. Maybe there is something *unreasonable* about hell. Maybe Christ is wrong. If he was wrong maybe he was a liar. In fact, maybe he didn't exist...

...and you see where this is going? You can call me ""reasonable"" at this point, but I'm not sure you'd call me a Christian.

If you are a Christian, and you believe in what Christ said, then you have to assume that he is not speaking lightly or the idea of ""everlasting fire"". You have to assume he is not lying, in other words. You have to assume, that there *is* some kind of responsibility to keep people from suffering in this way, and that is by exposing them to Christ, if only to give them the *opportunity* to say yes.

He grabbed with all his might, and ripped the skin from her body. Her muffled screams fell flat, and no one came to her help. The blood aroused Tito more than he'd ever been aroused. It reminded him of the stories his mother used to tell him of the ancient Hawaiian sacrifices in which the subjects would receive wounds to which the sacrificers would rape. He couldn't wait, Tito grabbed a hammer and smashed at Reggie's ribcage, again her screams were not heard. After breaking an opening to her insides, Tito plunged in. He thrust in and out in complete ecstasy. The pain was unbearable for Reggie and she lost consciousness. Tito came almost immediately, but he was by no means done. He pulled out of her chest, his penis dripping blood and semen. Tito cleaned his dick off with Reggie's tongue.

He thrust it in as far as he could and grabbed on to the first organ he could, and then pulled out. He ripped out her entire small intestine and part of her large. Tito started to giggle and coiled up the small intestine like a rope. He noticed the sun was coming up so he had to finish in a hurry. Tito went to his clothes and dressed himself.

You can go read up the reactions back when ANH was first released. People were fanatical about those movies because they were *so good*, and so ahead of their time. Their use of special effects enhanced the story; it had to, because the effects weren't able to take center stage themselves. That's why there's so much dialogue between characters in the battles in the OT; there had to be. But it makes them better movies.

People expected the prequels to be the same level of storytelling as the Star Wars movies they loved. They wanted the ""Do, or do not; there is no try"" Yoda. They wanted a romance to challenge Han and Leia; they got wooden scenes where Padme and Anakin only fall in love because apparently the script says they had to. They wanted the Battle of Hoth bigger and better, instead they got eyegasms where millions of clones blow away millions of droids but nobody really feels any tension. Nobody wanted Jar Jar, but they got him anyway.

I think the release of TPM is a big part of the reason why nobody respects the prequels even today.

Your stance makes as much sense as a man getting upset if his girlfriend/wife looks at a purse, or a house, or a different television. You're contextualizing the relationship into an exchange of goods, which is an unhealthy outlook, and is objectifying of both parties.

A man can look at another woman, and a woman can look at another man, and it can mean nothing more than just a look. This can be healthy to the relationship, as it let the other partner know that they didn't win, and can just let their behaviors, habits, and appearance go to pot, because they've ""caught"" the other person.

I disagree.  The Germans suffered the ""Stab in the Back"" during the first World War that resulted in the hyperinflation and disgrace of Germany before a single-shot was fired on German soil.  Nazi propaganda placed a spotlight on the role Jews played in global events, specifically the Communist Revolution in Russia, the role the Jews in the United States played in getting the US involved in WWI via the Balfour Declaration, and the role the Jews played in instigating strikes at German arms manufacturers that greatly contributed to eventual German surrender.

So I don't think any country would simply choose a minority for genocide.  That genocide would have to be partially responsible for some sort of injustices that could be used to unite the majority in perpetrating such a large-scale condemnation such as the Jews in Germany from 1933-1945.

Kid was selling drugs on the streets. Police were monitoring for some time, mistakingly thought they saw a gun. Police attempt to make an arrest, call for kid to stop and surrender himself. Kid runs into his house. Police still in hot pursuit and with every legal right enter his house. Kid runs to washroom to flush drugs. Police officer gives order to surrender. Kid ignores. Police officer thinks he sees a gun. Police officer shoots and kills.

Things to consider

- Guns and violence are so common that a police officer is conditioned to shoot the second he is faced with the threat of a gun. If what he thought he saw was a gun and he hesitated like reddit thinks he should have, he could be dead or wounded
- This issue boils down to human error in a situation of life or death. The cop thought he saw a gun when in reality there was no gun. If there was a gun then he was justifed and the kid is just some thug drug dealer who pulled a gun on a cop. There was no gun so now the cop is worse than hitler and the kid is a saint who never harmed anyone in his life and probably would have spread his ideals of peace and love through urban poetry.

What I did see were dozens and dozens of Tamil Tiger terrorist attacks. It is very bloody and horrible.

In MIA's Paper Airplanes, it seems to me that she's simply laughing about how she's going to take your money and use it to kill people. The Tamil Tiger agenda is for an independent state, but they are going about this through violence which is the wrong way to do it.

The video where the Gingers are getting murdered is the way that MIA wants most people to view the Tamils in Sri Lanka. That is not how the Tamils in my experience are treated. I know in the past there have been issues, but now it's just all out guerrilla warfare.

Well, perhaps things were better in Sweden. I'm not as familiar with their history. But certainly women could not vote in the United States, or most of the rest of the world. There are still places where they can't. You can't say that about men.

The age thing is a red herring. Nobody can vote at 17, but at a certain point men got to the point where they could vote and women did not. If I am refused a basic civil liberty, does that make me less of a person? Maybe we should stop letting black people vote again since clearly there's nothing wrong with that.

Of course some people want to go to war. I just read a series of interviews with a bunch of young guys recently before, during and after their tour in Afghanistan. Some of them expressed great anticipation for going there. Women want to defend their homeland as much as anyone does.

Were women ever forced into slavery? Of course they did! Are you kidding me? And that's ignoring the huge issue of sexual slavery that still exists for many women worldwide.

Yeah, and why is that? The question of ""why"" should be part of the debate.

  * True, impartial legal advice on the situation regarding the EU
  * A realistic estimate of how much oil Scotland will take

Yes, some of this is likely to depend heavily on the general terms that are set out in any negotiation with rUK.  Yet the situation with the EU, especially, is something that a team of independent lawyers could answer with at least a certain amount of certainty.

&gt;it seems a bit backward to have the biggest writing subreddit a place for critiquing

You can't have writing without critique, because there is no one catch-all guide for writing something, even when we're going down to the level of the different genres (because, like in all kinds of art, people like bending or even breaking the rules).

Anyone who cannot accept constructive critique - and apply that critique to further refine his/her craft - cannot become a better writer. Think of it as someone pointing the cracks on the wall of the house that you're building: as the engineer of the structure, you will have to fix that eventually or else it'll fall down on you. However, as the engineer, you should be able to distinguish the difference between a superficial crack that can be easily remedied (something like a typographical error or an awkward sentence) compared to one that compromises the structural integrity of the piece (a character you can't sympathize with, an anti-climactic ending or worse a story you simply cannot understand). And as the engineer, you can pick the ones you should fix up first.

Maybe it's just my experience in four semesters' worth of creative writing classes, but I learned more from those workshops and the one-on-one critiques than sitting in the classroom and being taught what plot is, what flat characters are or memorizing the classic quote ""show don't tell."" To learn how to write, you just have to practice, read more and have patience at your craft - no manual will able to teach you that.

(And before you blast me for not critiquing hard enough, let's just say I critique the pieces that I genuinely liked, which are few and far between. That, and I spend more time on [/r/soccer](/r/soccer) nowadays.)

&gt; while the links which tell you how to write and how to critique are hidden in some tiny new sub.

[That's why I want a ""how to critique"" thing on the sidebar, so people can see it before they post critiques and hopefully improve critique in this subreddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/pebe0/what_should_the_future_of_rwriting_look_like_who/c3oopwl) Maybe have something on how to write too, but anyone can just easily google that.

Yep, gather round kids, and I'll tell you the story of how I facial'd Katie Vasquez, the token fat cheerleader.

 The year was 2006, and Gnarls Barkley's Crazy was on top of the charts for 12 straight weeks, I was a freshman at University, and had been dating a curvy, light skinned ""latina"" named Katie Vasquez who just so happened to be a cheerleader for my school. Her bronzed skin, used to glow in the crimson uniform she'd wear after games--and her scent, he scent was unmistakable, they say ethnic women, smell a bit peculiarly, and perhaps this is true, but I was intoxicated by it.

 I'm not sure what Katie saw in me, I remember I walked up to her after leaving my residence building to see a big crowd of people, and asked her what was  going, and she told me it was a pep rally for the evenings game, and I should stick around as it would be fun. Having been a nerd all of my life, I had never actually attended a Pep rally, and while her friends, mostly the jock types and stunning physically perfect women (albeit dense), didn't particularly like me, they put up with me because I made their friend, Katie, happy. And again, I have no idea why.

 We went out a few weeks after that, Katie actually arranged the whole thing, she was like that, always wearing the pants in the relationship and leading us. She was the one who made the first move on the first kiss, the one who after 3 more dates, made the first move to the bedroom, and even was the one who introduced me to her father (a very strict catholic Texas man who for some odd reason liked me better than any of Katies previous boyfriends) It wasn't very alpha, but it worked.

 Anyways, now that you know the backstory, back to the facial. Well Katie as you know always had to push me to get me to do what she wanted, and as we had been dating for over 6 months now, she was quite comfortable pushing me into each of her desires. It turns out, her Dad had every right to hate the boys she was dating before, because they groomed Katie to be a total weirdo in the bedroom. Everything I thought I knew about sex was always turned upside down. Quite literally. Just thinking of that hurts my back.

 One day while we were having sex before my next class, she whispered into my ears, ""I want you to cum on my face"", now my heart was pounding so I didn't quite hear her, that or I didnt believe her. Cum on her face? I thought that only happened in pornos. We stopped for a second, as I asked what she meant, and she told me how she needs cum on her face, and how even though she knows I'm not that adventurous in the bedroom, I needed to do this for her, she just loved the way it felt on her face, and loved to lick it all up, and because she had forced me to eat pineapple for 4 days straight she knew it would taste so sweet. She pulled me into her face, looked at me in the eyes and said ""Just do it baby, just cum on my face"" and then kissed me, and we resumed our double backed monster dance.

 After  a few minutes of fornication, I pulled out and jumped up and stood on the bed. Katie, propped up to her knees, closed her eyes and puckered up jsut as Kristen Bell is doing in this picture, and she whispered ""oh baby, I want it, I want it so bad"".

 I looked at the clock, it was 8:49, I had class in 11 minutes, and I still needed to run across campus to get to class... and my dick wasn't in that happy zone where you know it's close to popping. POP POP. I kept stroking my penis, but nothing, it was hard, it...it just wasn't doing anything. The one time in my life when it would have been okay to ejaculate sooner, my body locks up and makes me a stamina king. Katie opened one of her eyes and giggled, ""you gonna cum babe?"" I kissed her forehead and stuck my dick in her mouth and let her suck it for a few moments and said ""you know it babe"". I pulled out, and she closed her eyes again, in that same Kristen Bell picture look, but I just couldn't. A cheerleader had fucked me, and sucked me, and I couldn't blow my load on her face. I was freaking out. I knew if I didn't do this, she'd eventually grow bored of me, and Katie was the best thing to happen to me so I had to act fast. I looked at my leg and saw a massive pimple, about the size of a loonie, by far the biggest zit I have ever seen...this was it. This was my one shot to destroy the death star. I continued to jack off my cock with one hand, then positioned my leg, over her face, and tried to squeeze the pimple with the other. I eventually popped the pimple, POP POP all over her face, with each hot oozy white stuff that flowed on to her face her smile got bigger, and incredibly, there was enough puss to actually compete with a healthy man's cum load...I faked orgasm and quickly jumped off the bed, put on my clothes on to make it to class. Katie just layed there on the bed, playing with the puss. ""Oh babe, it tastes sooooo good"", ""mmmm it's so sweet"", ""it's so creamy"" each time she said something I almost puked, but then she wiped it off her face, and slid it all down her throat. I made my hot girlfriend eat my pimple puss. I could never look at her the same way, and ended up transferring schools never to see her again. When my girlfriends now ask me if I'll cum on their face, I decline and say that I'd much rather kiss them after sex as it's so intimate, but the truth is, after using Neutrogena's new face wash that Kristen Bell promotes [http://youtu.be/Acy6ifpOPoU](http://youtu.be/Acy6ifpOPoU) , I haven't had any pimples, so I was scared to go in without a backup plan And that my friends is how I facial'd on Katie Vasquez.

You have got to be shitting me. That is the most ignorant statement I have heard in a long time. So ethnic cleansing, decades of occupation, etc. have nothing to do with it in your eyes?

&gt;Gaza, being part of Egypt during 1948-1967, never been given to the Palestinians in order for them to have their own state, nor the Palestinians demanded it.

Gaza is a historic part of Palestine. As a Palestinian, that statement to me is about as retarded as saying that someone in New York does not want to be part of America.

It coming under the administrative control of Egypt does not change anything. It's like saying Indians are actually Brits because Britain colonized India. To any person with even a semblance of rationality, it makes zero sense.

&gt; Same goes for Jordan and the West Bank.

Again, Jordan unilaterally annexed the West Bank. That does not change the fact that 700,000 people were ethnically cleansed and that the Palestinians had their land stolen from them, or the fact that this forms the basis of the conflict.

&gt;With that in mind, please, tell me, what is the ""opinion of Egyptians that counts here""? could they ask for anything more than what they got?

The opinion that counts is that the Palestinians have been treated like dirt and been dealt a huge injustice, and that their country, as an Arab state, should not have close relations with the very state responsible for this.

&gt;The core of the Israeli-Arab conflict lays in the textbooks of the Arab students in the middle-east. You might find it difficult to have peace with people who were brainwashed since birth to hate Israel.

i.e. people who have not been brainwashed to ignore history and think in a purely pro-Western, pro-Zionist mindset.

(E.g., from Brood War and Warcraft 3: **LAN**, server selection, **unlimited account creation**, **win percentage**, chat channels, chat commands, clans, and a functional custom game list)

While I do agree on a majority of points, there's plenty of arguments for the points that I've bolded that are justified.

For anyone who doesn't follow Starcraft at all, they automatically think blizzard is the devil for removing LAN. For anyone who actually does, there's an insanely important reason for the removal of it in order to protect it's own property. With Starcraft 2 being one the E-sports giants, people making money off their titles without giving back anything to it's creator is a big deal. And with the fear of KESPA potentially switching, they wanted to make sure they play fairly.

However, the only thing that was negative is that they haven't given a Tournament client. But again the counter argument is that all it takes is people to get a hold of the software and reverse engineer, completely negating the reason of removing lan in the first place.

For unlimited accounts, I actually think it was a good idea they didn't implement this. When blizzard finally wanted to make their personal ladder more relevant (unlike Starcraft 1's), the idea of having people to create a ton of smurfs and getting them into GM really weakens the deal. This makes individual accounts more important.

But again, what they should have done is accommodate for this change, either create separate ladders or have 1 account to allow for 2 extra side accounts.

Win percentage has been discussed to death. It was implemented in order to motivate the player base. And if someone really needed to know their win/lose rate, they could find out through others starcraft trackers (or use SC2 gears, for anyone who genuinely care about their win/loss and extra features)

Starcraft 2 has quite a bit of shortcomings. However, even with some of the new (old) features re-implemented, they can't suddenly stuff everything in one shot. They will have an oppertunity with HOTS, but I know a lot of people won't hold their breath for much changes.

And lastly coming back to Diablo 3. Gamers will always think that the decisions Blizzard has made is always evil, when the gaming industry is a growing and changing machine. I don't understand whats wrong with no VOIP (since everyone uses skype/vent/teamspeak since they're clearly superior services) as well as the reduced amount of players (4 is a standard these days and less of a clusterfuck).

And graphics? The game is fine the way it is, especially with how many new things are going in the game like havok and environmental destruction. But I wouldn't mind any improvements over the Beta, unless that's not the final settings since it's merely the first chunk of Act 1.

I will never understand why people label Blizzard as the bad guy. They are a business and they make money. If they can get more people to play their game, they will make changes to accommodate. They could do better, but I'm happy with their products and will continue to make my guaranteed purchase of Diablo 3. They don't pull shenanigans that are clearly the EA method and they have workers who are actually happy and motivated to do their job.",0,,gamernews,,t1_c3oyfb4,2015-07-01 10:54:18.000000,,

Also, that study was WEAK - let's see it with more people and better methodology, most clinical studies use hundreds if not thousands of participants in order to find some stronger evidence.

If someone wants to post legal photos of pre-teen girls, let them post legal photos of pre-teen girls in their own subreddit that you never have to see.

I didn't even know it existed before now, and I probably won't remember it exists by tomorrow. It's not my thing, so it's not my concern, but I'm not here to lead the moral brigade to shut them down because it's ""wrong.""

I absolutely love cannabis. I frequent /r/trees. There are people out there who would say it's a disgusting drug forum filled with criminals and should be shut down. I don't think it should be shut down. Do you think it should be shut down?

It's a slippery slope.

Don't discriminate simply because it's not your interest.

Just because a person is attracted to underaged children does not make them a sex offender.
We don't choose what we're attracted to, but we do choose how we act. Maybe if people finally understand and start to accept this we can find ways to actually help pedophiles and ephebophiles without ostracizing them and threatening them with violence.

**ETA**: I keep getting the same responses to all of my comments, all completely ignoring major statements simply to make themselves feel better about insulting me, or something. I'll just summarize it here:

----------------------------------------------------------
I have not and will not go to the subreddit.

Actually, it's a required step to get anywhere near equality.

You can't have equality without removing the biological advantages granted to women.  Two of the biggest are that women can reproduce and that the male sex drive has a much stronger hold of men than the female sex drive does over women (the two are so dissimilar that the only thing they really have in common is that they are both sex drives).

Once those advantages are no longer something women hold of men by virtue of biology, women will no longer be privileged compared to men due to those factors.  Once men no longer need to rely on women for sex or reproduction, they can finally treat women as they would men: equal.  When maintaining access to sex nor the future raising of a family  is no longer a factor for men when deciding to enter/maintain a relationship... when the value of the relationship is based solely on the companionship of the person... when, omg, men no longer have any reason to *objectify* women... they will treat relationships with women mostly like they treat their relationships with men.

If everyone has an inherent right to privacy, then 90% of the content on reddit is immoral. You can't just focus on content that you yourself happen to find offensive, and ignore the implications made for the rest of reddit.

Bottom line: nothing illegal has been posted there yet. When that changes, then by all means, get the fuck in there and delete it. If it continues, then you might be justified in taking the whole subreddit down. But I see no difference between you deriving pleasure from an image of a teenager getting hit in the groin with a football, and a man deriving pleasure from an image of a fully-clothed pre-teen. The only difference is that one form of exploitation is socially acceptable and the other isn't.

Most pedophiles are well aware that society frowns on their sexual proclivities, and are disgusted with themselves, even though they can't do anything to change who or what they're attracted to. I say, as long as they're keeping their desires to themselves and not acting on them, who are we to make them feel like they aren't human? I've felt like killing someone before and chose not to act on it. Feeling something isn't immoral. It's the decision to act on it that may be immoral.

The aggression doesn't befit South Korea and Japan.  Right now, North Korea isn't really in the consciousness of modern south koreans.  Making money off of fried chicken, pop stars, commercialization is.  Japan has its own problems to worry with, especially with the stagnating economy and natural disasters.

While I agree that NK has been a thorn in China's side, it is more beneficial than not.  NK is a wild card that keeps the US on its toes and acts as a buffer against the West.  Weakening that is counterproductive to their security because it would bring the US closer to China.

Finally.  1. China is nowhere prosperous, safe, free, and well-fed.  Yes, there are 400 million in the middle class.  But there are 800 million in the proletariat class that is basically used as slave labor to uphold that middle class.  Ppl don't work at Foxconn for pennies an hour with no benefits for no reason.  Given that decision, I rather be in NK doing labor.

2.. China does not need 25 million workers.  It has 800 million in poverty already.  Also, Koreans would be discriminated against.

From what I have gathered over the years it would seem people generally have some negative feelings about the playstation network.  I see it constantly being griped about how the experience sucks, it doesn't work, live is better, steam is better, etc. etc.  That is strike 1 for PSN.  Now they get hacked, that is fuel to the fire of the already brewing dislike of their service.

Steam on the other hand has had an overwhelming amount of positive feedback.  People are always praising it for how it is a great service, games are cheap, etc. etc.  Valve at this point is in pretty good standing with most people.  Then they get hacked, maybe a few days pass and they let everyone know in a detailed post to everyone.  People are advised to take precautions, etc. etc. the overall tone of the message isn't much different from the one Sony sent.

To recap tldr;
   Sony waited weeks for the first disclose, Valve waited days.  People seem to already not like PSN as much as a service (before hacking event) and Steam is the exact opposite.  Thus, people's views of such updates are affected.  Like I said the initial posts of the hacking events weren't much different (only in timing) so the way people receive them is likely due more to how they already feel about the service.

Overall I think the second disclosure is not as important as the first.  Valve was more timely in the first than Sony was, this second one is just a nice update to see how things are coming along.  Either way it is of no consequence to me as on the first disclosure I as an informed and diligent consumer protect myself immediately by changing my passwords and credit card numbers.  Sure it is inconvenient but shit happens and the main party to be blamed should be the hacker as they truly caused the inconvenience for everyone; users and companies alike.

That's why this market is pretty stale at the moment, and the reason WoW became so popular. Back in 2004 when WoW released, the MMO market was pretty diverse, in a sense, because no one game actually copied each other. WoW came in, did an amazing job at creating a solid MMO, and continued to prosper. Other companies wanted a cut on this and tried to mimic them while changing a few things around, they eventually ""failed"" to gain large audiences.

The problem is, they literally take WoW and twist a few things around to make it a ""Unique"" experience. SWTOR did this with its story leveling scheme, and that's all they changed. Other than that, it's the same exact game as WoW, only more shallow. You'd think after all these years they'd be able to hire someone who actually plays MMOs for the past decade and get their opinion on games other than recent ones, but I guess that's too hard.

Other games like Rift tried to emulate WoW and did a decent job, but the problem is, these games aren't Blizzard, so they will always look bad in other players eyes. When you make a new MMO today, it's automatically compared to WoW, which imo, is stupid.

Either way, SWTOR didn't do anything new. The leveling experience is less interesting than other MMOs, and the full on speech in every single quest is tedious.

I enjoyed it for a few days, but I never subbed. I didn't make it to 50, but I've watched other people play it, and I'm happy I didn't keep going. They ate my $60 but that's as much as they get from me.

First, I would say that gold should be put in a similar category to currencies. The advantage of gold is that it is likely a currency for many countries -- so no single one can devalue it via inflation, and it's also not affected by the crash of one.

There is, of course, the danger of a bubble, due to psychology, so it certainly could be a poor investment. But I find the whole 'unproductive' aspect is misleading.

Similarly misleading is the praise of companies, as though none had ever gone bankrupt. I think they (as an investment class) are an excellent hedge against inflation, since in general they sell things in various currencies, which then scale with inflation, but it's pretty easy to find periods (and even pretty long ones) where just about any investment class comes out ahead. And they can also have bubbles, as many of us have painfully experienced.

Finally, I find it strange to lump land/property in with companies. It seems much closer to gold, although there is the productive aspect (my impression though is that the production aspect tends to be a pretty low return on investment, but I really have no idea).",0,,business,,t1_c3pyp52,2015-07-01 10:48:12.000000,,

Well, in the proper sense, Scotland is more Scandinavian than it is Nordic. But in particular it's much more close to Denmark/Norway than to Sweden/Finland.

I'd say Swe/Fin has a much stronger connection to Estonia than Scotland does to the Nordic countries. The Estonian-Finnish connection speaks for itself. But Estonia was also part of Sweden for quite some time (and much more recently than the Viking Age excursions to the British Isles). Estonian has a lot more borrowed words than Scottish has from Norse languages. Like Finland, Estonia has had a native ethnic Swedish minority for centuries. (Even if they've dwindled after the Russians deported many of them [to Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gammalsvenskby)) Etc.

I'm not anti-Scotland, but I'm doubtful about how 'Nordic' they feel. Mostly I think all this recent talk is a play by the Scottish Nationalist Party (being politically social-democratic) to get Scots to look more towards the Nordic Social Democracies as a role model. While, at the same time, creating an alternate identity for themselves. But it's still a fact that they're mostly British and mostly identify as British, even if they identify as Scottish first.

(One might ponder the fact that the title associates Denmark with Hamlet - an English play rather than something actually Danish)

2. Children have little rights in general. The consent of the photo is that of the parents and many times, those images were taken by parents. The fact that someone is receiving sexual stimulation from said images is irrelevant - that would mean everyone who's jacked off to pictures of friends on Facebook is a criminal, as well.

4. The censorship being requested by the original poster is invalid because there is no crime being committed in the /r/Preteen_Girls subreddit, regardless of your or my views of it. Advice on how to seduce and rape a child is **not** illegal unless such an event occurs that can be tied directly to that post.
5. Sexual suggestiveness is dependent upon the intent of the image that portrays the alleged suggestion. If it was not intentional, then it was not sexually suggestive.
6. Pedophilia deals with **children under the age of pubescence**. Puberty can arrive as early as 7 years old. Use your labels correctly if you're going to use them at all. In ancient Rome and Greece - one of the most successful civilizations to have ever existed - 10 year old children were sexually active and it was accepted as natural. In over 60 countries in the world today, 13 years old is the threshold for adulthood. The concept of how children being sexually active is ""wrong"" is a fallacy brought by people whom are too ignorant to understand that it's NATURAL. I agree, people should wait before becoming sexually active and should only have sex with people they love, however I have no right to prohibit someone from having sex if they wish. Just because I disagree with it, that doesn't mean I should stop it. Think like a Utilitarian: it's not wrong unless it's detrimental to society. That's secular logic for you.
7. **Pedophilia is not synonymous with rape, incest, molestation, sodomy, or sexual activity with a minor.** A person with pedophilia is not a pedophile by legal definition. A pedophile is someone who actively acts upon [his] urges. Someone with pedophilia is someone who merely has the sexual fantasies. Believe it or not, there are at least one or two people with pedophilia in your neighborhood at this very moment. They just don't act upon it. Millions of teachers, government officials, officers, and athletes have pedophilia and people don't even know it. So what? Unless they hurt someone because of it, pedophilia isn't wrong.

I don't blame Evra for accusing Suarez of a racist slur - in a foreign language to one or both of them, misunderstandings can happen. (Please note, I am not going to say that Suarez did or didn't racially abuse Evra. By now there are so many different accounts and opinions, I've given up on trying to decide) If Evra thought he had been insulted in that manner, he was right to complain to the ref, and subsequently the FA.

The problem I have is that Suarez and LFC have some justification for having some serious complaints about the way the FA has handled the case, and the verdict which resulted. None of these complaints should have been directed at Evra or MUFC at any time. By doing so, it was always going to build to this moment, especially by accepting the ban on the day of the City game, knowing that today could have been his first game back.

Critera:

In order to better determine whether a visual depiction of a minor constitutes a ""lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area"" under 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A), the court developed six criteria. Not all of the criteria need to be met, nor are other criteria necessarily excluded in this test.[1][2]

    1.Whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area.
    2.Whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity.
    3.Whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child.
    4.Whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude.
    5.Whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity.
    6.Whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.

Case Law:

Concerning the lascivious display of clothed genitalia, the Department of Justice described use of the Dost test in child pornography and 2257 documentation regulations in a 2008 rule, writing that the precedent United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733 (3d Cir. 1994) did not prohibit ordinary swim team or underwear model photographs, but ""although the genitals were clothed in that case, they were covered by thin, opaque clothing with an obvious purpose to draw attention to them, were displayed by models who spread or extended their legs to make the pubic and genital region entirely visible to the viewer, and were displayed by models who danced or gyrated in a way indicative of adult sexual relations.""[3]

You are a weak agnostic. Not that it's impossible to consider every idea man has ever had, just that we haven't. However, you can categorize beliefs based on similarities and disprove that. But you have to identify the similarity and prove why it is illogical. And don't say ""gods,"" because that term is entirely undefined. You have to identify concepts, not words. The christian god has no similarities to the Jewish G-d. But Allah is exactly the same as the Jewish G-d. So if you wanted to categorically reject a concept, you could scrap Jewish G-d and Allah together. But you have to say why. Otherwise, what's to stop idiots from categorically rejecting scientific theories without individual consideration? Do I have time to go through scientific american and individually disprove each theory? No. I'll reject them because they don't require G-d.

No! What they did was block part of reddit for whatever reason they saw fit as is their right. Zero oppresion involved because most people can just press a button and log into another service.

* Story - was actually interesting, better than (in my opinion) 'unite the races to save the world!!' story of DA1, as well as most other fantasy books/films/video games.

* Combat - it was actually pretty much the same as in DA1, just the abilities were flashier.

* Voiced character - I think sacrificing customisation for stronger, focused character development is well worth it.

* Conversation system - a significant step up from Mass Effect, there were icons to give an indication of the tone of your response and no points awarded for choosing to be a goodie or a baddie forcing you into a specific choice.

The bad:

* Repeated environments - this is a given, it sucked

* Spawning waves of enemies - this was an unfortunate byproduct of making the combat flashier - if your abilities take out 4 guys, you need a lot of guys to kill for it to be challenging.

The original calculation was that each vote in low population states would be worth more, now with natural and political changes over time a million votes in one state can effectively be worthless, while just a handful in another (see Florida in 2000) are infinitely more valuable, regardless of population size. And the small states lose too.

Bush had the lowest vote percentage of any twice-elected president in modern history, and didn't even get a majority the first time. The public knew better. I don't know a single pundit who thinks Santorum could even come close, but Bush actually happened. The electoral college was meant to protect the minority. Now it makes a small minority of swing states all powerful, and turns voters in most other states into spectators.

So it's though to pin down, but you do know it made you really angry and that I must be crazy. We're off to a great start!

&gt; Well, first off you picked out the Kunsthaus, Graz. This building faced the challenge of begin the first new building in the area for a couple of centuries and responds to this by a rejection of pastiche - which is what you're talking about. It was received by the local community with hugely popular response. So yeah, you dropped the ball on that one.

Well, trading anecdotes about popular opinion is no way to settle anything, but [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/pfyl2/the_barbarians_are_inside_the_gates/c3pam2z) is from someone who actually has to look at it. Rejection of pastiche is good, but only if you have something worthwhile to do instead.

By the way, to use the word ""pastiche"" you have to agree that there has been a cultural break.

&gt; Don't believe the hype, napkin doodles do not become buildings. It's nice to think that people can oversimplify the complex engineering and building process that goes into creating such complex forms in this way.

Barbarians with advanced technology are still barbarians. If you imagine the 20th century without the technological progress, you'll see my point more clearly.

&gt; like wise, you don't get far in this game being random. Architects are not the only ones involved on such complex projects.

So because it was actually built, it can't be uninspired schlock? You do realize that the decisions are made by actual politicians?

As for the rest:

I agree that classical architecture builds on technological limitations that are no longer valid.

No. It was a criminal act. What I do think is unreasonable is you trying to abuse this to question the moral legitimacy of zionism in Israel - which is the definite goal of anti-Israel propaganda.

&gt; BTW Bernadotte was a UN mediator who was murdered by Zionist Jews in 1948 basically because he insisted upon his belief that the ethically cleansed Palestinians also had rights that needed consideration.

No, actually, he was murdered by a small group of radicals for taking an anti-zionist position - the position of further reducing the post-Mandate Palestine so that Jews get even less land than they are entitled to (as you and your ilk never fail to fail to bring up, Israel today sits in 10% of the area that was originally designated for a Jewish national home, since the British activated art. 25 of the Mandate and gave 80% of the territory to the Arabs), as a part of a larger armed struggle to drive the British out of Palestine, and without authorization of the Israeli government. It had nothing to do whatsoever with ""ethnically cleansed palestinians"", because anyone who's read a book would know that the said ""ethnic cleansing"" consisted chiefly of civilians fleeing the war zone after having supported the effort of uprooting Israel, as was the infamous case with the Kastel village which triggered the assault on Deir Yassin.

I have heard every possible rationalization why Israel is evil and Jews don't deserve equal treatment, with Lavon affair, King David Hotel bombing, USS Liberty and Bernadotte assassination being the top four. You take them out of their correct historical context and abuse them to smear Israel.

&gt; I realize, that was and still is a very difficult concept for most Zionists to comprehend. And that sometimes those intellectual difficulties cause the affected party to resort to murder.

Murder goes against the innocent. The Arabs who initiated the conflict by mounting an armed resistance to Jewish immigration - which was an exercise of Jewish rights - were not, in any way, innocent.

""Thus the truth of the statement of the prophet becomes apparent, 'If learning were suspended in the highest parts of heaven the Persians would attain it'"".


Ibn Khaldun


""Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna.""

I'm sure I'll find all the validation I need in the downvotes this post will get, but if you want to ever stop the mindless status quo, MFA will need to acknowledge and make an effort towards the different types of style needed for different men.

Even [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code_\(Western\)) is a great place to get started.  MFA needs to specify the classes there at a minimum and accept that that the casual-Target-clothes-and-boots-circlejerk is great for **one** kind of dress (Casual), but it isn't the end-all of fashion in general.  Also, in any given category, I'll listen to folks like Veroz, etc, but I have a hard time deepthroating them like the rest of MFA because they're somewhat knowledgeable in one area of dress.

* Streetwear (MFA says: ""Ha, look at those apes"")
* Casual (MFA says: ""OMG Levis and Boots 4eva"")
* Business Casual (MFA says: ""Our creative-focused jobs / student events don't make us dress this way, so this doesn't exist, despite probably being the most relevant category to most people subscribed to MFA"")
* Smart Casual (MFA says: ""We have limited ability to comment in this area, but when we do it's usually helpful with a ton of comments from the majority Levis-and-boots crowd who don't really know what they're talking about in this category)
* Business Informal (MFA says: ""An extremely small minority of us actually know anything about this and get drowned out by 'HOWD I DO' Smart Casual posts.""  Spoiler: You did OK, but need to get your dress shirt brought in on your midsection)

Agree with you completely.  The US used to have competing currencies at one time, and these kind of things did happen.  People were left holding currencies that were completely worthless. Look up [wildcat banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_banking)

Also even worse, the big difference between the 19th century competing currencies and now is that Ron Paul wants a government mandate of the competing currencies (edit: he uses the term legalize) alongside the dollar.

Interesting, so the anti-government candidate needs government ""coercion"" to implement his policy. No hypocrisy at all here.

Bitcoin is certainly legal. There is nothing stopping any private entity from issuing currency. But good luck getting the entire country to use it. Unless the government mandates it use, accepts it as payment of taxes, it is not going to happen.

  This is a timing issue.
  I have no idea where this person got this information.
  Televison has always run at 60 Hertz in the NTSC (USA method) broadcast world.  The interlace method works on 60 cycles a second.  60i, or 'smooth 60' that a lot of people are used to on their video cameras has 30 (or 29.97) frames a second split over two frames, only showing odd/even lines in every 60th of a second.
  When you pause, it combines the two, so you can see the image frozen.


**  29.97 is Drop Frame. ** The whole world of NTSC basically runs on Drop frame.  30 frames/sec is NON-drop frame.

  Why do we use NDF, you ask?  It's a timing thing.  More specifically, it's akin to leap year being used in the Julian calendar to not throw off the winter and summer cycles.

  If you use NDF or a true 30 frames/sec for your show, at the end of a classic hour of television, you actually have more frames.  Doesn't make sense, but it's true.
  If you take the 30 frames/sec, and you sync audio for 30 frames per second, at the end of the hour, your audio and video sync is lost, somewhere in the order of a second.
  Most consumer machines in America for years naturally ran at 29.97 fps interlaced, so you don't see motion artifacts or never realize it's a 60i, that is, until most screens became progressive 'computer monitor' style LCDs that only broadcast a progressive 'scan down' method.

  That's when things recently changed, and conversion was a matter of computing, instead of analog methodology.

All the time, I see this religion-bashing mentality coming from this subreddit, and it gets abrasive, even to a fellow atheist. I can walk around my campus on most days and see ""the shouters,"" you know, those christian guys that stand around all day telling gays they are going to hell and shouting religious messages at passerby. Now, aesthetically, I think those guys add a lot to the campus atmosphere, but as far as getting a message across, fuck that guy. He's insulting people in an abrasive and public manner, and expecting them to then convert to his religion. Unfortunately, I see a lot of atheists doing the same thing, only less publicly. So many times, I see these posts that boil down to ""haha, stupid religious people, if they were smart, they would share our worldview on the existence of supernatural entities,"" or ""goddamn religious folk- all the world's problems are their fault."" Then while these sentiments are posted all over the internet, which, by its nature, is a public forum, the atheists wonder why so many people think that the default for being an atheist is to be a condescending asshole (who is going to hell).

Personally, I'm not against religion. I think it is just another piece of the sociopolitical  landscape of the world, and I see no reason to actively try to convert people to atheism, nor to condemn those who practice a religion, just because they do. People can have many reasons to believe, or, more likely, no reason, and therefore see no reason to change their beliefs.

However, if some atheists want to do the equivalent of ""spreading the word,"" I would rather them take a more effective and humanizing approach. At my university, every weekday the Hare Krishnas serve lunch in the quad (You may know the Hare Krishnas as the people who (used to?) hand out books of their teachings in the airport). The food is tasty, and they request a ""mandatory"" donation to eat, though everyone has heard someone's story about the time he/she had no money, and the Krishnas let him/her eat anyway. Now, this is obviously a ploy to get people to join their (nice, peaceful) cult, since they do this at a net loss of money. However, I have never once felt pressured to join them in anything religious. The closest it has ever gotten is that, every once in a while, someone will hand out some fliers advertising the free sunday lunch they have at their commune, where they will talk about being a Hare Krishna and all that. The whole method they have to converting people is ""hey, we have an awesome system of belief that really helps us enjoy life. We don't care if you join, but, if you ever want to, here we are. Here, have some food!"" And I respect that.

With that budget it has to make decisions about what they spend on what. Do they hire more doctors so they can diagnose illnesses faster? Do they hire more surgeons so people can get surgery quicker? Do they pay for more effective Chemotherapy so cancer survival rates improve? Do they spend more money on smokers, or on morbidly obese people?

There are thousands of people who die on waiting lists for surgery, or because more expensive better treatments are not offered. You could spend 100% of a nations GDP on healthcare and there would still be people who died, but wouldn't, if you could spend 105% instead.

There is absolutely no argument for ""absolutely no one should die from lack of money"". There is not infinite resources in the world. As long as there are finite resources in the world, decisions have to be made at where those finite resources go.

The argument is between whether the state makes those choices or whether individual consumers do.

It is not an argument between a fantasy world with infinite resources and a world where there are finite resources.

&gt;And quite honestly, the Republicans are the ones saying that it's ok for people to die, here.

That's an extremely dishonest thing to say. Are the Democrats going to say that anyone can have any treatment they want as long as it increases their chances of living?

If they can they're going to have to spend the entire national budget on healthcare, take out the maximum number of loans possible, and even then people will still die who wouldn't have if more money was spent on them.

There simply are not the resources to give every person on the world the best possible treatment.

There is always a point you have to say ""this person is more deserving of money than that person"" or ""we don't have enough money to save this persons life"".",0,,atheism,,t1_c3qktb0,2015-07-01 10:39:18.000000,,

The difference is, I try to figure out the facts hidden behind the bias by comparing other articles with what has been said here. Do I always come up with the ""truth""? Nope, but it's better then relying on one, blatantly biased, source. And yes, I do read the reports that are listed on Halifax.ca, and no, I don't take every word they write as divine truth.

This went on for years before the admins and Rich Kyanka pulled the plug because the secret about SA's Piracy forums had become too widespread, funneling thousands of users to pay the $10 registration fee exclusively to download pirated content. At this point, the file hosting went offsite, but the sites were owned and operated by moderators(appointed by the admins) and required users to have a SomethingAwful account before registering(confirmed by inserting a unique key into their SA profile).

**Exhibit A: Vociferously Supports an Anti-Racist Agenda**

""Libertarianism is the enemy of all racism, because racism is a collectivist idea that you put people in categories. You say, well blacks belong here, and whites here, and women here and we don't see people in forms..or gays. You don't have rights because your gays, or women or minorities, you have rights because you’re an individual. So we see people strictly as individuals. We get these individuals in a natural way. So it's exactly opposite of all collectivism and it's absolutely anti-racism because we don't see it in those terms. ""

-[**Ron Paul on Bill Moyers Journal, January 4, 2008**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2r29HcH5nA&amp;feature=youtu.be)



**Exhibit B: Ferociously Insists that Courts and The Death Penalty are Racist**

“That’s a pretty good question. Because people, somebody asked me yesterday, ""When was the last time you ever changed your opinion? And I said well, it's been a while since I've had a major change of opinion, but I try to understand and study and figure out how things work you know and become better at economics and all.

But on that issue (the death penalty), I did have a change of opinion. And I stated this in the debates last go around, they asked…they asked a similar question, ‘when did you change your opinion last?’ And uh, and it, that was just not overnight, but I, my position now is, that since I'm a federal official and I would be a U.S. president, is I do not believe in the federal death penalty and in my book “Liberty Defined”, I explain in it more detail , but basically I make the argument for, uh, against the death penalty but I would not come and say the federal government and the federal courts should tell the states they can't have the death penalty anymore. I don’t go that far.

But no, I just don't think the uh ..with the scientific evidence now- **I think I read an article yesterday on the death penalty, and 68 percent of the time they make mistakes. And it’s so racist, too. I think more than half the people getting the death penalty are poor blacks. This is the one place, the one remnant of racism in our country is in the court system, enforcing the drug laws and enforcing the death penalty. I don’t even know, but I wonder how many of those, how many have been executed? Over 200, I wonder how many were minorities? You know, if you're rich, you usually don't meet the death penalty.”**

**Exhibit C: Stubbornly Refuses to Deny That Government Legalized Racism is Cruel and Unjust**

“No form of political organization, therefore, is immune to cruel abuses like the Jim Crow laws, whereby government sets out to legislate on how groups of human beings are allowed to interact with one another.

Peaceful civil disobedience to unjust laws, which I support with every fiber of my being, can sometimes be necessary at any level of government. It falls upon the people, in the last resort, to stand against injustice no matter where it occurs.

In the long run, the only way racism can be overcome is through the philosophy of individualism, which I have promoted throughout my life. Our rights come to us not because we belong to some group, but our rights come to us as individuals. And it is as individuals that we should judge one another.

Racism is a particularly odious form of collectivism whereby individuals are treated not on their merits but on the basis of group identity. Nothing in my political philosophy, which is the exact opposite of the racial totalitarianism of the twentieth century, gives aid or comfort to such thinking. To the contrary, my philosophy of individualism is the most radical intellectual challenge to racism ever posed.

Government exacerbates racial thinking and undermines individualism because its very existence encourages people to organize along racial lines in order to lobby for benefits for their group. That lobbying, in turn, creates animosity and suspicion among all groups, each of which believes that it is getting less of its fair share than the others.

Instead, we should quit thinking in terms of race—yes, in 2008 it is still necessary to say that we should Stop thinking in terms of race—and recognize that freedom and prosperity benefit all Americans.”

**Exhibit D: Refuses to Deny that Courts Discriminate Against Minorities**

“But in order to attract Latino votes, I think, you know, too long this country has always put people in groups. They penalize people because they’re in groups, and then they reward people because they’re in groups.

But following up on what Newt was saying, we need a healthy economy, we wouldn’t be talking about this. We need to see everybody as an individual. And to me, seeing everybody as an individual means their liberties are protected as individuals and they’re treated that way and they’re never penalized that way.

So if you have a free and prosperous society, all of a sudden this group mentality melts away. As long as there’s no abuse — one place where there’s still a lot of discrimination in this country is in our court systems. And I think the minorities come up with a short hand in our court system.""

-[**Ron Paul, CNN Western Republican Debate, October 18, 2011**](http://youtu.be/kaSLxCwb0eY)


**Exhibit E: Refuses to Back the Unfair Punishment of Minorities**

""A system designed to protect individual liberty will have no punishments for any group and no privileges.

Today, I think inner-city folks and minorities are punished unfairly in the war on drugs.

For instance, Blacks make up 14% of those who use drugs, yet 36 percent of those arrested are Blacks and it ends up that 63% of those who finally end up in prison are Blacks. This has to change.

We don’t have to have more courts and more prisons. We need to repeal the whole war on drugs. It isn’t working. We have already spent over $400 billion since the early 1970s, and it is wasted money. Prohibition didn’t work. Prohibition on drugs doesn’t work. So we need to come to our senses. And, absolutely, it’s a disease. We don’t treat alcoholics like this. This is a disease, and we should orient ourselves to this. That is one way you could have equal justice under the law.""

-[Ron Paul, 2007 GOP Presidential Forum at Morgan State University, September 27, 2007](http://youtu.be/8fl0vy44GO0)


**Exhibit F: Vehemently Insists that Drug Wars Harms Blacks and Other Minorities Disproportionately**

“…the federal war on drugs has wrought disproportionate harm on minority communities.

Allowing for states’ rights here would surely be an improvement, for the states could certainly do a better and more sensible job than the federal government has been doing if they were free to decide the issue for themselves. And although people studying my record will discover how consistent I have been over the years, they will uncover one major shift: in recent years I have dropped my support for the federal death penalty.

It is a dangerous power for the federal government to have, and it is exercised in a discriminatory way: if you are poor and black, you are much more likely to receive this punishment.

We should not think in terms of whites, blacks, Hispanics, and other such groups. That kind of thinking only divides us. The only us-versus-them thinking in which we might indulge is the people—all the people— versus the government, which loots and lies to us all, threatens our liberties, and shreds our Constitution.

That’s not a white or black issue. That’s an American issue, and it’s one on which Americans of all races can unite in a spirit of goodwill. That may be why polls in 2007 found ours the most popular Republican campaign among black voters.”

I don't see how I'm defending Suarez with this post at all. Just because I am pointing out the hypocrisy of SAF does not mean I am defending Suarez. It is possible to point fingers at more than one side. Multiple Man Utd fans were criticising Evra for his celebrations, while criticising Suarez for refusing the handshake.

The whole point here is how SAF is an incredible hypocrite. Multiple Man Utd players refused to shake hands with Vieira before a Man Utd-Arsenal match, and this was right after there was some sort of scuffle/argument in the tunnel. During those years, the Man Utd-Arsenal match was incredibly heated and full of bad blood. Refusing to shake hands with the Arsenal captain was incendiary and disrespectful. You don't see him sacking those players from United.

The article I linked shows that Ferguson was fined for making racist remarks. Now you might not agree that Italians are a race, but in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/pms9v/it_is_disgraceful_that_someone_who_makes_racist/c3qlz87) I listed that nationality is considered as race by both the United Nations and Crown Prosecution Service. I probably shouldn't, but I'll try to break it down for you.

In Suarez's case, I'll use Evra's testimony for the sake of fairness. Suarez calls Evra the equivalent of ""blackie"" several times. He says that he does not want to speak to Evra because he is black. So Suarez refers to Evra's skin colour a few times, and displays a personal dislike of black people.

In Ferguson's case, he makes a generalising statement regarding all Italians, stating that they are all liars. He also goes on to state that the tactics of Italian football is to be ""scheming, diving, referee-baiting"", but that's not racism since it only targets Italian football instead of Italians as a whole.

One calls a person by his skin colour. The other makes a sweeping negative generalisation about a race. Let's not compare them here, but wouldn't you say it is really pretty hypocritical for one of them to say what he did about the other one?

1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area;

You talk with James and you find out pretty quickly that you really don't have much in common and after speaking with a mutual friend it's possible he doesn't care much for brown people. Do you spend the rest of your life trying to keep James from being happy? Do you follow him around constantly interrupting his dates, job interviews, social situations, etc. handing out flyers to everyone within a 100 foot radius that have evidence of why James is a shitty human being?

I'm a firm believer in free speech, as sickening as I may find something I believe people should be allowed to say whatever because it then lets the world know their position, be they moronic/pedophillic/racist. When a thought is out in the open the person has to defend it and his/her argument and persona will fall on its validity to the rest of us.
As long as blatantly illlegal images aren't being linked then this is all knee-jerk nonsense and furthermore it demeans the internet as a whole if such discussion cannot be had. Remember the internet is not print media and can not and must not ever be held to the same editorial rules. It's a forum for peoples opinions, wrong or right.

Why is this important ? Because it all snowballs. One minute we're banning entire subreddits with photos of teens due to dodgy comments. What if teenage boys were making comments about teenage girls? next we're deleting general porn subreddits because family associations find them disgraceful, next we'll ban social dissent subreddits cause 'they're full of terrorists' and so on.

Who amongst us has the most subversive morals? For censorship to occur the censors must be observing the material to censor and who appointed them morally superior to do so? / whats to say they aren't morally depraved themselves or become so after days of viewing suspect material.

I never visited these banned subreddits but if users were posting illegal material a simple thread stating so and IP banning would have sufficed (and contacting the police!) To sweep up some sort of moral outrage from church groups with reddit.com as a mascot for pedophilia and its users being advertised as condoning such illegal activity is sensationalism.

It's worked though. Illegal material has no doubt been removed. But along with it our ability to discuss any socially grey areas that NEED discussing.

A final layer of this whole debacle is; who governs the morals of an ""International Society"" which is what the internet is? Remember, again it's not print media and shouldn't be held to the same editorial guidelines.

Nintendo didn't start out making games either (well, they began before video games). In fact, they even tried their hand at cab companies while they were still a relatively small playing card company.

Miyamoto didn't invent gaming anymore than Jobs, they both did their own separate things to the market. I'm not trying to make it into a dick swinging contest about who was better at it.

Although if I must clarify, Miyamoto did much more solely for gaming and practically made the market.

They will do it since they'll have to *anyway* after they have to pull you over and give the fucking speeding ticket that I'm sure you'll dispute.
* ""Stop acting like you're the police!!"" - We don't. We likely either sit at the speed limit or set cruise control to it and try to ignore chucklefucks like you that have no regard for OUR preferences, trying to force YOUR decision on other people.
* ""I'm justified in tailgating you, somehow!!"" - Ever been on a two-lane highway in an area with animals? Get the fuck off my bumper so that if I have to stop for deer, elk, or whatever else, you don't fucking rear-end me if a rapid stop is necessary.
* ""I'm just saying you need to stay out of the left lane so I can go fast!!"" - The left lane is for passing *within the speed limit on interstates.* Good fucking luck trying to do that in a metropolitan area such as on the Maricopa down in Phoenix where everybody is everywhere or in the Twin Cities where you have nearly as many left-hand exits as right.

Notice how there is always some ""informant"" and the plot ""gets botched"".

That's very much the M.O. of Mossad, which explains the recent ""plots"" against Jewish targets in Azerbeijan and Thailand by ""Hizbollah/Iran"" - something which makes no sense whatsoever but makes great headlines to demonize Israel's enemies and ""proof"" of antisemitic motivation.

Let me explain: Mossad's greatest strength is its pool of people (not its proficiency as some wrongly believe), something every secret service in the world can only envy. Since Israel is a country of recent immigrants, Israel can easily recruit Israeli Jews from Arab countries or from Iran (or any other country in the world for that matter) or even Jews from any of the Jewish communities across the globe - they are indistinguishable from their country of origin's population.

They train them and send them to recruit terrorists, pretending to be Iranian/Hizbollah agents (sounds familiar? They recently posed as CIA agents). They will always find some poor schmucks who would fall for this for the right amount of money.

They supply them with plans, instructions, sometimes even explosives, defective explosives or explosives that can be detonated by remote control, for terror attacks against Jewish targets. Then they call authorities to inform them about a great plot brewing to attack Jewish targets. The plot is foiled/botched (notice that they are always foiled - how? Azerbaijan and Thailand are not known for their tight security services, which means they got an inside tip from ""someone"". And if they are not foiled - if something goes wrong - you have an attack against a Jewish target, a proof of the ""evil terrorists and antisemites"" Hizbolla/Iran). The poor schmucks who were hired to carry out a plot confesses that he was hired by Hizbolla/Iranian agents, because that's all he knows. He has absolutely no way of knowing that those are Mossad agents.

The bottom line: they both do the evil deed and reap the reward while implicating Hizbollah/Iran and also scaring Jews who'll in return support Israel even more or some would even move to Israel - it's a win-win-win-win for them (and the hapless Americans who caught whiff of those tricks can't even complain in public as was in the recent case with Mossad agents posing as CIA agents - because of domestic politics and fear of confrontation with the so-called ""ally"" - but it's obvious someone was mad enough to leak the story to the press). In addition, such as the ""foiled Iranian terrorist attack"" in Azerbeijan recently - it serves to inflame Azaris against their neighbor, and further isolate Iran. Add another win for this false flag strategy.

Edit: I highly recommend Victor Ostrovsky's book ""In Ways of Deception"". Although some of it may be fictional, the essence of it how Mossad operates, is true.

Believe it or not, there's a little more nuance to theoretical disciplines like political science than you'll find on dictionary.com.

The ""fact"" of the matter is that if you think that politics or political theory are fact-driven fields, then you simply don't know what you are talking about.

Even the economic principles of Austrianism (that you espouse) are explicitly stated not to be proven or disproven by facts, but only through first principles.

But really, keep searching on dictionary.com I'm sure you'll find something that ""proves me wrong again"".

Already you can see those are very similar amounts of money.  If you are a team looking to send your players to one of these events, and you see MLG is completely stacked with top korean pros looking to qualify for Pool play in the main championship, then no way in hell are you sending them to that.  Maybe you send your best player, or maybe you decide your best player winning assembly would be better and send him there.  Either way you are especially not wasting any more money than is absolutely necessary sending your players to such a stacked tournament they are so unlikely to place high in (and hence gain your team exposure).

MLG are simply eliminationg the risk for the korean teams, which means they are far more likely to get the best pros they can at the winter arena.

It's not really an MMO, but it can come close by the ancient definition, as well as close to the size of today's public instances in many (so-called) MMOs. Mostly it's a casual alternative to Second Life, but there are some fully PK-legal servers. These tend to have extremely small safe zones just for spawning; you can't stay in them or return to them once you leave.

Once you do leave *everything* is fair game including your stored inventory. The flaming ruins of once-impressive castles and other landmarks are a common sight. Even if someone doesn't mean you harm, they will probably wreck the place digging around in search of your hidden chests, all of which can be looted. Apart from plugins designed to thwart cheating, there are seldom any enforced consequences.

The best of these servers will ban you for hours or even weeks upon death, simulating either a long spawn timer or a semi-permadeath which expires when the map is reset. Because of this many of us spend a lot of time underground or sneaking around. It doesn't make for an action-packed game, but it does prevent the low player count from making the game feel small.

Rvalue references and move semantics eliminates one of the biggest previous uses of pointers: where you want a function to allocate a large object and return it.  Now you can just do it by value:

    vector&lt;int&gt; make_large_vector()
    {
        vector&lt;int&gt; v(5000);
        ....
        return v;

    auto v = make_large_vector();

Move semantics ensures that this large object that is returned by value is done efficiently -- as efficiently as returning a pointer, but without the added burden of the caller having to be responsible for remembering to delete it.  No pointers, smart or otherwise, are necessary.

And even if you have a case where you do need shared ownership, for functions that simply need to observe an object you pass a const reference, not a smart pointer.  Passing a smart pointer by value incurs a significant overhead (atomic increment) and is generally not necessary.  And for things that aren't expressing ownership, like a child pointing back to its parent in a tree, smart pointers are not necessary -- just use a raw pointer.

Pointers in C++11 should be reduced to a few rare use cases, unless you're a library implementer.",0,,cpp,,t1_c3rgdgi,2015-07-01 10:29:28.000000,,

From the Findings of Fact in the United States versus Microsoft antitrust case:

&gt; One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed.

So, in other words, Microsoft threatened all of their partners (not just one company) to increase the price of their license (not stop discounts) if they kept selling computers without their product.

Yup, still not relevant as it doesn't compare labor to executive, so it's a dimensionless component. There's nothing to gauge the data by.

&gt;And the quality of healthcare hasn't increased in lock-step with the cost increases? Cancer treatments and organ transplants have pretty much been revolutionized over the past 30 years.

Quality of life, pal. My TV is a shitload better than one 30 years ago, but I'm paying far, far, far less. Why is healthcare not subject to economies of scale or cost regression through process improvement?

&gt;Productivity is a poor metric, since it is one dimensional. What you have here is the issue of reduced production workforce on top of increased production efficiency through technology. The reduced workforce size works to put downward pressure on wages and the production efficiency works to put downward pressure on the demand for labor.

And I could argue that reduced workforce size puts an upward pressure on wages by increasing competition between workers and thus competition between firms seeking skilled workers; while production efficiency concurrently requires higher skilled workers that puts an upward pressure on wages.

Basically, I see you arguing from the same viewpoint that has encouraged, enabled, and excused the explosion in exec compensation while justifying the falloff in labor compensation.

Little humans need room to think, to experiment and grow - i'm not saying they should be unsupervised but it's important they have room to break the rules occasionally, to make mistakes and think on their own - if they don't have this then their biological brain can't grow, they can't learn hormonal and emotional responses.

The two friends that took their life last year felt they had no one to talk to, feeling that could easily have gone that far back (both were younger than me).

tl;dr Simply put, it does not show a lack of trust. Does asking you if  you put your seat belt on, or even looking to see if it's on, show a lack of trust?

Edit: Downvotes huh? Apparently you think that all kids are good. There are a lot of messed up kids that should be monitored by their parents in this world. You've all met them in high school, some of you may have been that kid. Regardless of the reasons that there is a lack of communication between them and their parents, it isn't always possible for the parents to ""just talk to them"".

My sister was one of those kids... just a bitch. She was in counseling, my dad would try to talk to her, nothing. Fortunately, she never acted out really badly, but I can't imagine what my dad would have given to just have a glimpse into her life or her mind to understand her actions. Hell, I wouldn't even talk to my dad. Our mother left when we were young, so that left one hardworking parent. One tired, run-down parent with no options but to just hope for the best.

He commends it for being good-looking. Uhh, the textures were actually pretty bad. Anderson has never been much to look at but I nearly vomited in some of the cutscenes. Also, the facial expressions were piss-poor. I mean, **bad**. You want to see it done right you go and play HL2, which has no cut-scenes meaning all the brilliant animation that went into portraying emotion was the game as it is normally.

Also, as mentioned in the other threads about ME3, the dialogue and voice-acting isn't exactly stellar. The voice-acting isn't too bad but whoever wrote that dialogue needs a good slap. More ""Humanity depends on us"" drivel. Plus, the way they portray the whole ""I told you so"" thing with Sherpard confirming the suspicions of his superiors is so cheesey.

Also, [Wrex died](/spoiler) in my ME1 yet [he](/spoiler) shows up in ME3? I think I remember something being mentioned about previous saves not meaning squat, is this proof of that? If so, *what the fuck?*

TB also commends the scale of the reaper invasion. Well, no, sorry TB, you're wrong. Remember ME1, the Citadel being attacked by the lone reaper? That thing clasped onto a pretty big chunk of the Citadel, which is a freakin' huge space-station, housing millions upon millions, if not a billion or more, of life-forms. If you think about it, all the different races, the different sections of it, in both ME1 and ME2, it must've been huge. So when this reaper comes in and goes to town, it has to be pretty big, right?

I didn't see that scale in this demo. Also, they seemed to just sit there, doing fuck all. These machines took over planets faster than that mission took. They just sat there, maybe spraying the odd beam. Stupid  and inefficient, very unlike a hyper-intelligent machine race.

He doesn't mentioned the AI, too. Business as usual here, they're (your enemies) all retarded. You'd think they'd do something about that, but nope. You just duck for cover, pop out and wear down their armour. The only time you'll get flanked (the most basic thing you could expect tactically) is if those enemies were programmed to go down that route and you happened to be in a position which would make it look like that you're being flanked.

I don't want ME3 to be bad, I really don't. But... I'm scared...

the ""jeans with nice jacket"" look is extremely difficult to pull off. what you're looking for is either:

* solid dark navy blazer (not a navy suit jacket) (EDIT: there are blazers in colors other than dark navy, but these are rare (especially at thrift stores), so for simplicity's sake we'll leave those out for now)
* jacket made out of a very textured material (think rough tweed, corduroy, velvet, open weaved linen, fuzzy cashmere or camelhair, rough textured wool, etc)
* smooth fabric jacket in a very loud, obviously-not-part-of-a-suit pattern (big bold windowpane, etc) but NOT a pinstripe. basically, a sport coat that is so loud and crazy that you cannot EVER imagine anyone wearing a full suit (jacket and matching pants) made out of the same pattern. for example: http://i.imgur.com/5qOf7.jpg

what you NEVER want for a jacket to wear with jeans is a smooth fabric jacket in either 1) a solid pattern, 2) a pattern that looks solid unless you're very close, or 3) a pinstripe. the only exception to this is a **blazer**.

Bandwidth isn't free to ISP's. They have teams of engineers that watch traffic trends and decide when new equipment, peers, fiber, etc... is required. In the past, the people who were using a lot of bandwidth was rare, and easily offset by the grandparents who only get on the intertubes to check their hotmail. These days it's a lot different. The average user consumes a lot more bandwidth. And ISP's are having to increase their backbone capabilities without gaining anymore customers.

A bandwidth cap, or, the more likely result, usage based billing, helps stymie those costs. ISPs aren't going to care if you use 5 petabytes of bandwidth in a month as long as they can charge you for it (and holy shit what a charge that would be!).

The over-the-top video solutions are increasing bandwidth, sure, but it doesn't have to generate as much backbone bandwidth. ISP's are going to start setting up their own content delivery networks or maybe even work with Netflix (or whatever over-the-top service is big on their network) and distribute video caching servers close to their own consumers. This would have the benefit of cutting down their backbone costs, and since Netflix customers would benefit from greater speeds and better reliability, maybe they can strike a deal with Netflix to pay for this. And it might even be worth it to Netflix since by partnering with the ISP's, they may be able to enter in an agreement where that traffic only counts as a fraction of your cap, or maybe none at all. That makes the Netflix service more attractive to people in that service area.

The whole arena is changing, and it's silly to think the only motivation for bandwidth caps is an archaic video model. With DOCSIS 3 modems becoming more prevalent, you're going to start seeing cable internet tiers in the hundreds of mbps. Why offer a tier that you can reach your cap in a few short hours unless they have plans to offer customers a way around them? Not to mention all those extra mbps allows a lot more throughput for the data-based video networks that is undoubtedly the future of that market.

Learn mofo, can you do it? Extrapolate, recognize the patterns, use the apparatus of your emotional aggregation capacity as well of your analytical thinking. Even if ""world making sense"" inside your brain does not translate to ""having intellectually and emotionally cohesive understanding of everything"", recognize your ability to to recognize your deficiencies.

You being not perfectly capable does not translate to the certainty, that there must be somebody who knows everything. It's just an absolutist wish of a man-child who can hardly deal with infinity.

If mathematical notion of ""everything else but those few things I've got here"" is translating or referring to god, then I guess every mathematician knows and struggles with it.

But ∞ - you ≠ god. Labeling everything your highly specialized world-understanding-filter can't process under ""god"" does not give it more meaning. It's by definition ""something you don't understand, something you don't know"" - Therefore still out of reach. Just grasping this label does not mean anything.

Acknowledging this limitation makes you a bigger man, but apparently, it also leaves you open to idiots assigning their own comfortable parroted labels to that realization, without really realizing what they are doing.

Organizations making up their own labels and whole systems of ""stuff nobody is supposed to understand, but fill your brains with it anyway"" are therefore the most dishonest, arrogant, sadistic exploiters of this VERY WELL KNOWN limitation of human condition.

Whichever, it's often not equal.

Just yesterday I was at the mall with my girlfriend. She said ""The store is this way, follow me."" After finding out that the store was actually in the opposite direction that we had walked, I simply rolled my eyes slightly. Then, she smacked me in the face. A lot of people would say ""you go girl, don't let your man show you attitude."" But then imagine reversing the roles. If I smacked her for any reason whatsoever I'd be vilified.

1) You don't know who else is on your team, and whether or not they are any better at using the jet than you are. I'm not perfect myself, but I rarely don't kill a vehicle or infantry (if no vehicles are being used during the sweep) during a given sweep. So I can feel pretty assured that I will do better than the level 3 guy who spawns into the Jet and flies around all game doing nothing, but not dying either.*

2) Your ""minute MAX"" statement is absurd. I've actually played several rounds with [JamaicaMeCrazy](http://bf3stats.com/stats_ps3/jamaicamecrazy#ps3) (sometimes I feel like he's following me). This guy has 14k kills in the frogfoot. Who knows how many total jet kills he has total that he has in the thunderbolt. While I couldn't come close to killing him myself in the jet, neither could he get me unless I got bored of the circle jerk dogfighting and tried including tanks swoops into my evasive maneuvers.

3) And that's the problem. If a Jet pilot is deadset on circling around until you get bored of chasing him and go for the enemy vehicles, he can usually surprise you eventually. I'm not trying to be an internet tough guy, but if you're on the PS3, please add me. I'd love to be proved wrong here. I will let you get on my tail, and please prove to me that you can kill me despite the fact that I maintain an ideal turning speed and mix up my turns so that you have to pretty much guess my next move if you want to stay close enough to kill me faster than my jet regenerates health.

*I admit that I usually start the match by ""testing"" the enemy jet. If I can tell that he is overall a bad pilot, I will NOT take him out. I want him in the jet so that another, more qualified, pilot doesn't get his turn. Then I will continue to take out every enemy vehicle, while scaring him off my tanks every so often, without ever killing him. And this is why, even though I'm not the GREATEST dogfighter out there, I will almost always take the jet if I can so that my team doesn't face the same fate as my opponents do when they have a level 3 dude flying their jet.",0,robcataus,battlefield3,ps3,t1_c3rxbp0,2015-07-01 10:22:22.000000,,

If conflicting judgments are made, then the two courts will need to seek out arbitration themselves. And considering that McCourt and Burger Court are probably at odds quite often, they likely already have arrangements for handling disputes with the assistance of an impartial third party.

But I also wonder how would arbitrators who are so biased stay in business anyway? If McCourt rules for the plaintiff 90% of the time, no defendants would ever agree to be tried by them, meaning McCourt would only get paid by one party. Courts that are independent and who's services are paid for by both participants are likely to make more money and succeed in the market.

Also McCourt's biased reputation is likely to catch up with them when doing business with others. After all, would you want to give a business loan to someone so shifty? Odds are they'd try to find some biased judge to avoid paying back your loan. How about office rental? Or any other agreements a business must be able to rely on.

I have friends in the units assigned to such events and have asked about their policies. What I have heard and verified with higher officers to be true is the following: Whenever an area needs to be cleared text messages are sent to the civilians to clear their homes (because they are not the targets), and in areas that are not considered Israel flyers are dropped from the air with the same warning. The reasoning behind the weird restrictions of new building [not limited to Palestinians, there are many restrictions placed on Israelis as well] is because Hammas were using these building sites as fronts and used building material as weapons and areas for smuggling. I'd also like to say the overall consensus of people regarding settlements is to give the Arab dominated areas to the Arabs, the highly religious though [who do NOT serve in the army and often attack guard posts in addition to 'terrorists'] illegally occupy the area because ""only God can control our borders"". Really inconvienient for peace talks.

2. There are some areas that people throw rocks for breaking religious code: Meah Sharrim and lately Beit Shemesh are the two crazy areas. But this is a WELL documented place and no one who doesn't live there honestly has no business of going in. There have been occasions of harassment, sexism [recent examples: Beit Shemesh illegally is trying to segregate roads so women can't walk near synagogues. Disgusting. And women sit in the back of buses in religious Jerusalem. I've experienced this myself...being in uniform and sitting in the front was a really awkward choice and I had no idea where I was since I got lost between bases]. I have not heard of rocks being thrown at children, just mobs shouting insults in yiddish, most commonly ""SHIKSA"" [dirty word for a non jew]. They are an embarrassment to the entire country.
3. I am all for Peace, I don't believe in a two state solution for many reasons: They were made an offer countless times in history, each time denying it and I know this is idealogical more than rational, I believe that it's unfair that they are many Arab countries in the world, and only one Jewish state. It is fact that the surrounding countries want NOTHING to do with the Palestinians and don't allow them into their borders. I believe how the Palestinians behave is at fault of their terrorist ""governments"" that have left them disadvantaged and oppressed. As long as these governments run rampant, there cannot be peace. Unfortunately they know nothing else. Also these governments are gorilla like in war fare and are extremely hard to target without getting bad PR. How can you destroy a leader that hides behinds it's people as a shield without being monstrous? There is a saying by Golda Meir: Once the Arabs love their children more than they hate us, there will be peace. Unfortunately I find that statement to be true.
4. I unfortunately am way behind on the Iran situation: all I know is about the [ever constant] threats of nuclear warfare, the suspicion of us targeting their Nuclear cores, and them like many other countries wanting to wipe us off the face of the earth. That being said, I think Iran is a threat to more than just Israel, nuclear energy in the Middle East by an undemocratic state is a finger waiting on a trigger. I believe it is in America's interests to also stop Iran from obtaining Nuclear arms [or realistically, more Nuclear arms than they have]. Just look at the revolutions going on all over the Arab world...they are too unstable for such a dangerous possession.
5. In my PERSONAL opinion, I wouldn't be surprised and I think so. I say that with no military opinion, any news influence etc. I know for sure though if this were to be true, it wouldn't have happened without America's knowledge, approval, and help in coordination.

Actually, it can really be said that you speak only from experience. Your entire perspective seems to be mainly based on your anecdotal evidence and selective evaluation of Judaism. I know several Jews who are friendly, modest, and integrated into general society. I didn't even know they were Jewish until they told me.

&gt;Jews think they are above criticism, but they are just following a bullshit religion

Basically every religion is bullshit, and most every religious follower thinks he is above criticism, especially in respect to his religion. And yet, you specifically seem to belittle Jews--why?

&gt;Where I live, we have a lot of problems with some extremist jewish sects who plainly count on the fact that them being jewish shields them from legal repercussions

FYI, this is true of any extremist sect. The fact that you use the adjective ""extremist"" with ""jewish sect"" and then go on to generalize about how you can't stop ""jews"" (implicating all or most Jews) from doing something illegal suggest you're strongly inclined to make vast generalizations about an enormous and diverse population based solely on your limited experience and seemingly targeted consumption of antisemitic literature, news, and history.

Are there crappy Jewish people? Yes. Are they crappy because they're Jewish? Probably not for the most part.

One of the things that helped me get past it was how someone explained to me that the Old Testament was, essentially, LAW. The Old Testament also talked about separating yourself from people if you're sick, not to marry a divorced woman, or a woman who is a widow, and how you CANNOT come to God face-to-face, etc. In reality, (to be a little brief, so I don't bore you with a whole bunch of information) the Old Testament laws were put into practice to show that, no matter what anyone did, we all really needed a Savior. So when Jesus came, He fulfilled all the laws for us. We didn't have to worry about being damned for anything, because Jesus sacrificed Himself in an act of love for us. Therefore, we don't have to sacrifice anything to get into Heaven anymore.

Also, no matter what anyone tells you, being gay doesn't put you in the 'out' basket. I think that people are quick to write off the other laws from the OT (widows can't marry and all that stuff) as ""not as bad"" as homosexuality, just because homosexuality is ""foreign"" to people. They don't understand that it's someone's life and that this person often has to endure hate and intolerance.

My church is pretty big on lgbt equality. :] We have a couple of small groups where some people from our church invite members of the lgbt community to let them know, ""Hey, this church is a family for you if you ever feel like you need some support or help or prayer.

Hey-oh. I just want to get something straight, real quick. Are we agreed or disagreed that it is neither ""men"" nor ""women"" to blame for the shitty relationships between the two sexes, but rather the reinforcing structures of society?? You are definitely right when you say that the wage gap comes down to mothering. Not all women are discriminated against in terms of wages, but mothers ARE. In that light, so are fathers. Fathers are discriminated against because the establishment of society expects them to be breadwinners (and if you tried the line about being a stay at home dad on me, lemmetellyouhowfastitwouldwork...) and rewards them for doing this (more $$ more promotions)-- and punishes them when they fail to do this (less $$ demotions when they won't work late). Society punishes women who want to stay at work, they expect them to be good mothers and stay home-- they keep them at low wages, don't offer promotions, and give them part-time opportunities so that they can be better mothers (this is society punishing them for being bad mothers). Sometimes I totally agree with what posts say in r/mensrights because folks are grabbing onto facts and watching social trends, but I want to be clear you aren't blaming feminists for wanting to eradicate the motherhood penalty (or fatherhood penalty)-- In other words, are we on the same page?

Sorry to break it to you guys, but language evolves. It's an organism (evolving, you might say, via memes instead of genes).

I feel like the evolution of words is one issue where most people, even the hardcore political liberals (ahem), will align with the conservative stance.

For example, the word ""access"" did not exist as a verb until the 1960's, and when people started using it as one, the language purists shouted from the rooftops that using ""access"" as a verb was akin to murdering babies. Now, most people don't even realize it used to be only a noun.

Another example is ""begging the question."" People use this phrase often to mean ""raising the question."" In fact, ""begging the question"" refers to a logical fallacy. Did you know that? It seems as if most people have already accepted this phrase to mean ""raising the question.""

We KNOW that as a matter of course, the creation of power is the same act as the creation of ABUSE of that power.

then the ayatollah picks a fight with israel because he wants the arab people to stroke his dick because the ayatollah wants iran to be a super power in that region of the world. so the whole israel vs iran thing blows up, and the u.s. backing israel made things even worse because americans love jews and feel bad about the holocaust or whatever.

then 9/11 happens and iran is like, ""damn, we hate the u.s. but that shit bin laden did was fucked up. plus we hate sunnis cuz sunnis are the dumb muslims. we'll help the americans with this war on terror bullshit."" so the americans get help but then shit hits the fan cuz there's reports of al-qaeda leaders and shit fleeing into iran, but iran denies it. then bush calls iran an axis of evil and iran gets totally pissed about it because they were put on blast. then iran hears about the u.s. wanting to invade iraq, and iran shits its pants.

I mean, the dangers of second-hand (and now third-hand) smoke should cannot be overstated. But if we're talking about the health of the smoker, we as a society actually *save money* when someone dies of lung cancer.

Lung cancer is considered to be the least expensive of all cancers to treat. Why? Because the prognosis is so shitty, and death occurs so soon after diagnosis. A person dying of lung cancer will die much more quickly than a person dying of a degenerative disease.

In addition, the average age of diagnosis for lung cancer is 70 years. For most of the population, they have already finished making economic contributions to society.

There are, of course, other diseases and conditions associated with smoking. But according to the CDC, a male smoker is **23 times** more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than a non-smoker.

I hope you understand that you are slandering right libertarianism and attacking a straw man.

""capital becomes the sole measure of power in society, which leads to a greater divide in the wealth of those who own the means of production, and the workers. It leads to greater abuses of the working class."" Good to see Marxist analytics is still alive and well, along with his classism. Of course his analysis is broadly discredited because his foundational assumptions like labor theory of value have been discredited (Labor theory of value was abandoned before Marx was even born and subsequently chose to bring it back as the centerpiece of his analytics.) No modern ""free market"" person would agree with your (outdated) characterization.

To counter, in a left libertarian society (without private property,) economic calculation is impossible (http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem), therefore there is no effective means to know what the best use of a given resource is. Previously the price mechanism allocates resources and bears risk through economic incentives. Without the price mechanism to effectively allocate resources that leaves the various political means of distributing resources. This is negative because political power structure has no rhyme or reason to base their decisions of who gets what and will systematically skew the operational results of these commitee's/consensus bodies, resulting eventually in the rise of a classical tyrant/fraud/corruption. IE In a situation where there isn't enough food for everyone to eat, how much do you want to bet that it won't be a committee member or their family that goes without? Those least represented within the political arrangement will suffer at the hands of those best represented.

As economic calculation is now impossible, society lives off the capital/wealth that was previously accumulated, these resources get consumed but are not replaced, therefore mass starvation/crop failure occurs as economic productivity becomes negative on the margin. With earths population standing at 7 billion people and with a hunter-gatherer type steady state arrangement topping out at supporting around .5 billion a large natural pressure for a die off will occur. So people start dying left and right until that political/economic arrangement collapses or we reach a sustainable population level, whichever comes first.

_In your guy's' minds, what do you think the economic system really does?_ Why and how do prices change, what does it mean when you go to the corner store and pick up a candy bar and it says .99 cents and then go across the street and for the same candy bar they charge 1.19? How do suppliers decide what price to charge? Why is it that diamonds are worth more than water when one is necessary for human life itself and the other appears to be a mere frippery? Is the price of labor (wages) related to the marginal productivity of the person in question? Is labor just like any other price in the economy? Is there a tendency for self correction within the economy which results in all people on average gaining wealth over time or do you think that social and economic forces result in a polarity dynamic, forcing people either downwards or upwards with no one in the middle?

The last one is particularly important, I would take the prior stand, that the operation of prices inevitably results in underutilized resources being profit opportunities, (say your marginal productivity is 10 $ and your wage is 1$, any competitor that understood this would be willing to pay the worker more inducing them to leave for that competitor.) To make it easier to see, I'll do it in steps. So say the original Firm is company A, the second firm company B hires away that person for 2$, thus himself internalizing the value addition of the difference between his productivity and his price/wages, in this case 8$. Well the same situation occurs again between company B and C, ad infinitum. This provides the upward pressure which explains how and why, counter to the polarity dynamic argument, why workers are not proletariots making the minimum necessary for subsistence. This also helps explain why a ditch digger makes less than a electrician or physicist. All prices have upward and downward pressures applied upon them and the price we see is an expression of the equilibrium price, the price that uniquely balances these pressures at a non-zero level. Thus it is not in the end unions or what have you that result in increased wages for society, but increased productivity that ultimately drives how wealthy a society is or is not.",0,,LibertarianLeft,,t1_c3t8h9n,2015-07-01 10:16:41.000000,1970-01-01 01:00:01.000000,

False.  Homosexuality is renounced all over the Bible in both the Old and New Testaments.

And it's not a mistranslation.  We don't need to ""show you the biblical Greek or biblical Hebrew terms for homosexuality.""  The most accomplished scholars and translators in the world just translated the Common English Bible last year.  They have done the work for you:

**Genesis 2:24**:

A man leaves his father and mother and embraces his wife, and they become one flesh.

**Romans 1:26-27**:

That’s why God abandoned them to degrading lust. Their females traded natural sexual relations for unnatural sexual relations. Also, in the same way, the males traded natural sexual relations with females, and burned with lust for each other. Males performed shameful actions with males, and they were paid back with the penalty they deserved for their mistake in their own bodies.

**Leviticus 18:22**:

You must not have sexual intercourse with a man as you would with a woman; it is a detestable practice.

**Leviticus 20:13a**:

If a man has sexual intercourse with a man as he would with a woman, the two of them have done something detestable.

**1 Corinthians 6:9-10**:

Don’t you know that people who are unjust won’t inherit God’s kingdom? Don’t be deceived. Those who are sexually immoral, those who worship false gods, adulterers, both participants in same-sex intercourse, thieves, the greedy, drunks, abusive people, and swindlers won’t inherit God’s kingdom.

**1 Timothy 1:9-10**:

We understand this: the Law isn’t established for a righteous person but for people who live without laws and without obeying any authority. They are the ungodly and the sinners. They are people who are not spiritual, and nothing is sacred to them. They kill their fathers and mothers, and murder others. They are people who are sexually unfaithful, and people who have intercourse with the same sex. They are kidnappers, liars, individuals who give false testimonies in court, and those who do anything else that is opposed to sound teaching.

**Jude 1:7**:

In the same way, Sodom and Gomorrah and neighboring towns practiced immoral sexual relations and pursued other sexual urges. By undergoing the punishment of eternal fire, they serve as a warning.",0,,Christianity,,t1_c3t8plm,2015-07-01 10:16:41.000000,,

If you think Obama has it in the bag automatically you don't understand the American political system or the strength of Republican scare mongering. Gas prices will be high, the debt has doubled in 3 years, and unemployment is through the roof still. Obama has a LOT going against him into this second election, even if most of the problems were caused by the previous party. The only thing Obama can really claim is GOP obstructionism and getting Osama, hardly enough to secure reelection.

I don't know why you are even worried about Republicans in the first place, because I don't know if you actually follow Obama's policies, but he is literally a Republican already. Not raising taxes? Check. Not coming out strong for gay marriage? Check. Immediately folding every time to GOP pressure? Check. Keeping the Bush tax cuts? Check. No stance on medical marijuana? Check. No real stance on immigration? Check. Allowing Wall Street criminals to continue doing whatever they please? Check. No solid stance on environmental issues? Check.

I feel that the underlying agenda is the abortion issue.  What pro-lifers fail to recognize is that legality isn't going to stop a woman from having an abortion.  It will, however, drastically increase the safety of those women who have to make that tough decision, if it is legal.

In the fiscal arena, the $360M they (PP) get from the fed.gov. isn't the bank-breaker.  If I had a choice in what I was ""required"" to pay-in for, I'd take them any day over our bloated Nat. defense budget (666**billion** in 2010 - or 20% of your taxes), DEA (2.4B - and fun fact here: The DEA intercepts less than **1%** of drugs in the US.) or Homeland Security (44.5B)...

Seems like some people need a reality check:

1) Games cost exponentially more to produce than they ever have in the past, mostly due to the modern expectations of graphics and the requirements to create those assets

2) Games have not risen with inflation at all - even with the new $60 pricetag we are still not paying as much as we were back in the 90s

3) It's very difficult to justify the immense development costs of a game to executives if it isn't an MMO. Why spend millions on a one shot game when you can spend millions on an MMO which creates a steady revenue stream? DLC is the compromise from this point.

Bottom line - just because the developers have some piece of content ready to go doesn't mean you are OWED rights to that content with the purchase - they can have Mass Effect 4 already done FFS and you don't 'deserve' it just because you bought Mass Effect 3.

No. Why should it be treated as business under *any* circumstances?

Why should they be held accountable for pursuing an education?

&gt;If an adult chooses to pursue education for which no marketable skill set is derived, it should rightfully be that adult's burden to pay for it.

That's a pretty sad state your society must be in where that is actually a valid answer to people pursuing what they are interested in.

&gt;Putting mental capabilities ""to use"" means producing goods or services that others find valuable

Not really. There are many worthy things in a human's life other than doing what's currently best for others. There is no ""demand"". Our society has progressed beyond a level where everyone can do something that's ""in demand"".

Something making you money does NOT mean that thing is valuable. Money is NOT an indicator of doing the right thing. Money is no indicator for anything but money.

&gt; In order to do this, a student must pursue an education that produces a valuable skill set.

A human *must* do nothing. A student, however, shows a certain level of mental capabilities when being able to complete a university eduation and we as a society need to find ways to use that potential.",0,,todayilearned,,t1_c3tz5xv,2015-07-01 10:13:02.000000,,

And that is fine, but the same thing can also be said about pedophiles and murderers.  Who I also do not like and have no respect for as most people do.

Now I do not believe they are a danger to society or anything like that hence why the operation should be legal (although I think the participant should have to be 21+).  And because their actions are not dangerous they should also have the same rights as anyone else (marriage etc).

I have to accept that fact that they are part of society and that is fine.  But because of who they are and the decisions that they have made in life I do not like them as a people and couldn't have any less respect for them as a whole.

I personally think I could deal with the fact that nature had made a choice for me and that I know we did everything we possibly could to fight nature. In the grand scheme of things, that child won't know anything that is going on so I don't feel that it will suffer, even though it is ingrained into our brains that they will. If the baby survives, five years is a lot of time for advances in medicine and surgical techniques. My cousin was a miracle baby, she had cancer when she was very, very young and survived. I understand your odds are not good. I just thought I might offer a different alternative. It's also an alternative that offers a sense of togetherness, that nature took it's course and nothing you did could make it work.

I'm pro-choice, people have the right to choose but I'm not so much pro choice when it comes to myself. The only way I could ever abort is if it endangered my wife, who would mean so much more to me if she died than a baby I haven't interacted with yet. The other way is if the child was going to be stillborn. Remember, i'm talking for myself only. Obviously I don't have a child, so I don't know what the attachment levels are for a male during SO's pregnancy.

Getting hopes up sucks but there's always a ""you never know"" factor.

My advice would be to make the decision that neither of you will start blaming one another for because your marriage may fall apart once that starts happening. You both need each other to lean on in these harshest of times in your lives and there is no way it will work if resentment begins to set in.

Take care. I would suggest some grief counseling in any decision that you make. The best thing for you both is to stick together.

Anyone can pick up a Bible and start their own church.  No church has members who all agree with 100% of doctrine.  So they often split off and start their own.  This is partly because there is no ""official"" religion, so there is no selection pressure to hamper the phenomenon.  Imagine an area with rabbits but no predators.  Rabbits everywhere.

They all say they are the TRUE one.  Except Unitarians, but if I had to guess I don't think that there are very many Unitarian churches.

Yes, the others are evil.

It ""works"", for lack of a better term, because they really do believe in religious tolerance--but only for other Christians.  And they don't consider Catholics Christians for the most part (some kind of do) and used to HATE them (the Pope is the anti-Christ to many of them) but now that the Catholics are fighting secularis, as they see it, they are ok.  Won't last, though.

And neither believe Mormons to be Christians.  From what I've seen, Mormons are by far the most insular and keep to themselves, so their beleifs are not well-known to most and they have limited interaction with the actual members.

I am in the West, and we have lots of churches, but next to none compared to the South.  There is one corner where there is a Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod Lutheran church and right across the street a Missouri Synod Lutheran church.  The diffference between them, as described by a WELS member:

""One goes like this (makes curvy road gesture with his hand), the other goes like this (uses his had to describe a straight line).""

&gt; BERLIN - More than 160 German tax collectors have volunteered for possible assignments in Greece to help the struggling Mediterranean country gather tax more efficiently, the Finance Ministry in Berlin said on Saturday.

&gt; German media published news of the possible tax advice mission two days before the German parliament is due to vote on whether to endorse a new 130 billion euro bailout package for Greece.

&gt; &amp;quot;Greece&amp;#039;s problems today are even worse than the problems faced with former East Germany in 1990,&amp;quot; said Norbert Walter-Borjans, NRW finance minister, referring to the period after German unity when west German tax officials went to the ex-Communist east of the country to help improve tax collection.

&gt; Israel&amp;#039;s more than 300,000 settlers are already double the number of Palestinians in Area C, which would form the heart of any Palestinian state.

We believe that Jesus is a prophet and an ordinary human being just as Muhammad (PBUH) was. When Jesus preached he preached an early version of Islam, not compete albeit, the message was completed with Muhammad (PBUH). Nevertheless, what we believe is that he was born of a virgin mother, he is not the son of god, because god does not have children, reproduction is a characteristic of finite beings that god created. We also believe that the bible originally was the word of God, just as the Quran is now, and that the people after Jesus, for their benefit, changed the word to suit their needs. This isn't secret or conspiracy theory, its well known, it was all changed during the Council of Nicaea. Some of the stuff that were changed were
* The concept of the trinity was formed
* Many versus in the bible
* Changing the date of Jesus birthday
* Introduction of pagan practices like Easter
* A lot more
The point is, the message of Jesus and bible is so changed from the original that its as if its something totally different. If Christianity does not make any sense to people (as is very clear from /r/atheism) it is because its not the what it is, its not the what Jesus preached in the first place. It shouldn't make sense. I don't know if this Bible in this article is real or not, but if a real bible were to be found it would hold, according to us Muslims, the same principles that the Quran does. Also, in the past the Church has destroyed all the original copies of the Bible before it was changed and persecuted people that still upheld the original message. Muslims also believe that the Vatican has an actual copy of the original Bible inside its secret archives.

I'm not sure if you're sincerely asking this and just playing dumb, or you really can't fathom it. This is really straightforward, and I hope it doesn't sound like I'm talking down to you, but I feel like this is so painfully obvious that you can't possibly be unable to grasp it. I'll explain it just to be sure.

For a while, years ago, SomethingAwful was highly regarded, it was *the* source of humor and memes on the Internet. Reddit has now taken that title (along with 4chan). So for people who were heavily involved at SA, they may view SA as their ""team"" or whatever. The fact that they pay subscription means they are not just emotionally invested in the site but also financially. A lot of redditors love reddit. If some other site were to eclipse reddit in popularity and influence some day, I imagine there would be a lot of dedicated redditors who might be butthurt about it. This same concept applies to SA now, a shell of its former glory. The dedicated stalwarts aren't content to just keep enjoying their community in SA. It looks like their activities against reddit are born out of butthurt and jealousy. Because for better or worse, reddit is in the spot that SA perhaps once occupied. Reddit is huge and influential. So the anti-reddit zealotry from SA comes across as butthurt whining and jealousy to a lot of folks. Bear in mind, for the people who remember SA here, they generally have a positive view of SA. So there isn't much (if any) anti-SA sentiment on reddit. SA is just seen as that site that was really cool a few years ago. But on SA there is a fixation on reddit, and it really seems like more than just altruistic stuff about saving humanity and whatnot. It just seems like some folks are ticked off that their site isn't the juggernaut it once was in the past.",0,,antisrs,,t1_c3v6pti,2015-07-01 10:05:05.000000,,

Quebec has a different culture than the rest of Canada, it has different values, it has different points of views. All of that, simply because Quebec is a different NATION.

Other problem is that Canada is a creation of its provinces. It is a paper entity that takes half of the taxation in Quebec. Now, at the creation of the federation, the provinces had alot less expenditures than they have today. The federal takes ALOT of money from the taxpayers, even if it has ALOT less of expenditures. Things that cost little nothing a century ago are now the bulk of the budget of the provinces. (Education, Healthcare, etc...) So, with time, the financial burden of the provinces has been growing continusly, that's one of the reasons why the Federal HAS to give back money.

My context is drawn from 15 years of living it - I'm a cop in a major American city, I'm adept at translating predator ex-con evasion talk into English.

The OP is speculating based on what the guy said and his own personal experiences, I'm speculating based on what the the guy said and my own personal experiences, having seen similar scenarios play out hundreds of times.

When a guy says ""The cops are out to get me, they don't like me"" this is frequently true...but it's leaving out the most important part of the equation - why the cops don't like him. The cops probably won't know your name, nevermind not like you unless you're consistently victimizing others. ""Cops don't like me""....Well heck, I don't like rapists, and if I have to interview that poor girl, hear about the horrible things you did to her, talk to her parents, I'm going to like you less. If you intimidate the  witness and manage to skate on the charges, I'm going to like you even less. If I bag you on a minor charge (something I would commonly give a break on to a regular Joe having a bad day), I'm going to be happy about it. If based on your record of abusing others, the judge decides to seperate you from  society for a couple of years, I'm going to be thrilled, because you can't rape any of the people I'm responsible for for a couple of years.

That's the way the game works. I'm not saying he is a rapist (that was a personal anecdote), but if he was living in a whorehouse in an area other commentators on this thread are saying is rife with human trafficking and child prostitution, it's quite likely the cops didn't like him for a reason.

He was living in a crackhouse. I suppose it's possible he had a legit job, but it's a heck of a lot more likely he was paying for his crack by stealing from others and generally making life miserable for everyone else every day. That's why the cops know his name, that's why the cops don't like him. They bag him on a minor charge and they're happy to do so. He commits so many crimes so often, the actual crime doesn't even register to him (water to a fish), it's all ""the cop didn't like me"". ",0,,IAmA,,t1_c3v7zvd,2015-07-01 10:04:05.000000,,

The way I see it, is that the only purpose for having a marriage license is so that the government can approve or deny marriages.  And marriages between interracial couples were denied in the past.

It is no secret that homosexuals want to be accepted by society to the fullest extent possible.  However they and their opponents make the classic statist mistake of believing ""Government = Society.""  There are people who accept homosexuality as a legitimate lifestyle (ie ""there's nothing wrong with homosexuality""), and there are people who do not (ie ""homosexuality is evil"").  So you have the statists in the former camp advocating for gay marriage and you have the statists in the latter camp advocating for traditional marriage.  Each side is trying to impose its beliefs on the other side.

This is why the ""old stick"" is so crucial.  If government gets out of marriage, what are you left with?  The two groups still despise each other, but they're powerless to force their own beliefs on each other.

Practically speaking, however, getting government out of marriage is going to be a nightmare, because it's been involved for so long.  There are so many other things that rely on marriage, such as tax benefits, healthcare, inheritance rights, etc.  Granted, the ideal solution would be to get rid of government involvement in all of these things, but people are resistant to changes of such a large magnitude.

For the record, I personally do not accept homosexuality as a legitimate lifestyle, but I think it is inappropriate to use force to prevent it between consenting adults.",0,,Libertarian,,t1_c3v7zvr,2015-07-01 10:04:05.000000,,

Short-term loans ('payday loans') have incredibly predatory rates. A quick google-fu search is showing rates as 'low' as 211% for a monthly loan, all the way up to 911% APR on a week-long loan.

Now, it's important to note that they won't pay 911% of what they borrowed-- the loan lasts for a week, not a year-- but they're still paying massive interest for a *very* brief, low-risk loan.

And it gets better, because the moment something goes wrong (and one more paycheck doesnt solve all their money woes), they have to keep borrowing and get trapped in a massive pit of ridiculous interest rates.

This isn't to say all lending is evil: I took a loan at a credit union and I believe a 1500$ loan over the course of a year cost less than 100$ in total interest.

So, even though the kid was borderline retarded, they still knew enough to be able to take advantage of their parent(s) and their unwarranted affection/doting. Eventually, they realized they could skate through school without doing anything, and even when they failed every class, their mommy and/or daddy would just yell at the teachers for flunking them. Soon, they would either drop out or cheat their way to a diploma/GED. After that, they sit at home, controlling their parent(s) by bitching/throwing tantrums whenever they don't get their way.


See, now that kid has gotten older. (Hopefully, you've since lost contact with the person you were thinking about from elementary school. If not, it's time.) So they've gotten fat and they've read Maddox's page like it's their bible, and they have come to think as though everyone, everywhere, is inferior to them, when, in reality, it's their own subconscious trying to forget what a miserable excuse for an existence they have had by projecting their own insecurities and failing onto others. They like to pretend they're part of ""Anonymous"", or that they're a hacker, when, at best, they're a script kiddie who can't even use others' programs properly.

Marriage is something that involves two people, not just one. If he doesn't want to get married now, then you have to respect that and try to understand why. It probably has nothing to do with you at all, just the thought of it is not appealing for him.

To give a bit of background, I've been with my sweetheart since high school and I'm about to graduate undergrad now (almost 6 years together). Neither of us want to get married for a variety of reasons: both of each of our parents has married early and divorced, money/paperwork, and really, we think we're too young to make such a decision. There's no mystery or clashing interests.

So I guess my ballpark advice would be to get on the same page as him. Find out why he doesn't want to get married, and if you find his reasons agreeable then I'm sure waiting a few more years can't hurt too much. Maybe he's not truly aware of how much you want to get married. Either way, talking through things is something that should be second nature by now, I think.

From the World Health Organization:

Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.
The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women.
Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths.
About 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of FGM.
FGM is mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and age 15.
In Africa an estimated 92 million girls 10 years old and above have undergone FGM.
FGM is a violation of the human rights of girls and women.
Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.

The practice is mostly carried out by traditional circumcisers, who often play other central roles in communities, such as attending childbirths. However, more than 18% of all FGM is performed by health care providers, and this trend is increasing.

FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person's rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.

Did you read that? Only 18% of all female circumcision is done by medical professionals. I am not talking about the clitoral hood and foreskin, I am talking about the motivation and medical quality of the procedure. ",0,,Feminism,,t1_c3vgc03,2015-07-01 09:59:58.000000,,

Then you speak to a supervisor. If not, you speak to the port director. All over the place are signs saying that if you have a complaint to ask to speak to someone. Except he was given a reason, later on. He just wasn't given a reason initially.

&gt;But why was the travel ban imposed verbally by the border agent, leaving no paper trail for them to follow or to contest?

The travel ban in the future might be imposed verbally, but they were given a written reason on their refusal documents for their turaround to Canada. They do have documents. When they returned to Canada, they received a form from the Americans telling the Canadians that they were refused entry.

&gt;""No arrests were made,"" Misztal said. ""No complaints have been filed. I have no other information whatsoever for you.""

As I said, you need to file a complaint at the time. Ask to speak to a supervisor. If the supervisor is there and it's the person you think isn't following the law, ask to speak to the port director. When you lodge a formal complaint, all of this is documented. If CBP agents have done anything wrong or illegal, it will mean their jobs. DHS does not fuck around with this sort of shit.

&gt;People refused entry to the U.S. may pay $545 U.S., non-refundable, for a waiver or redress application that can take up to a year to process, according to Customs and Border Protection.

&gt;Roch Tasse, president of the Ottawa-based International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, said people seeking to reverse a U.S. travel ban often ""get the runaround"" and the ban stays on.

Yes, because it's not enough to just apply for it. You need to actually get an experienced immigration attorney to help you. You have to provide supporting documents for your case. For these people, the first step would be filing a FOIA on their stop and learning what they can so that they can redress CBP's grievance with them. They should get documents proving they are not the criminal the US is looking for.

&gt;Tasse called what happened to the Benaoudas ""racial profiling"" and guilt by association.

Tasse is wrong. These agents never profiled anyone. When you pull up to the wicket and they scan your passport, if you are flagged for any reason, it shows up. These agents have no ""anything"" one way or the other. If the computer tells them to detain, they detain. Their job is following procedures. For whatever reason, they have been put on some sort of watch list. That's why you file a FOIA. You need to find out if it's right or not.

&gt;Tasse said imposing the ban verbally, with no written record, is the usual procedure, making it difficult for travellers to reverse it.

You cannot be returned to Canada without documentation. Your passports are held and you are escorted northbound. Then you are handed your documents, passports and forms showing refusal of entry.

&gt;The agency is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The department says its Traveller Redress Inquiry Program aims ""to welcome legitimate travellers while still securing our country from those who want to do us harm.""

&gt;Benaouda says he was given no opportunity to explain he was a ""legitimate traveller.""

No one at the border has the power to reverse these decisions. Just as they didn't make the choice to detain him, they also do not have the choice to release him. That's why he needs to go through the Traveller Redress Inquiry Program and sort this out.

&gt;Benaouda, who is more at ease in French, says he found it difficult to understand the Arabic translator, because he spoke Egyptian Arabic. And he wonders what the translator told the FBI.

If you don't understand the translator, ask for a new one. The gov't can bring one up on a conference call at a moment's notice.

&gt;""Your father's name is identical to that of someone else,"" Abdelaziz said. ""That is why we did this.""

Then these people should fix it! But if you don't do anything about it, they won't fix it. CBP doesn't want to have to detain these people, call in the FBI from down in Plattsburgh and do all of this for nothing. They have more important things to do. Help them fix the problem. These border agents are just as powerless as the family.

As for your last argument, that the foreskin has more nerve endings than the clitoris... that just proves my point, if anything, that the two are incomparable and any attempt to qualify one with the other just debases both arguments.

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_Arabs_and_Muslims) is a Wikipedia page on the issue.

A large scale, unwavering attack on Islam and Arabs is at least 100 years old. All that was before the Zionist occupation of Palestine and before any of the common terrorism-related excuses American Jews use today to justify those portrayals. There was no Hamas back then, no 9/11, nothing, they started it, and have been doing it ever since.

It's not a surprise. None of this is some wild anti-Semitic conspiracy kneaded with hate and baked in ignorance at a radical fundamentalist gathering with prints of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion proudly flashed as far as the eye can see; what I'm saying has been prophesied by God and his prophet 1400 years ago. Chapter 5, verse 82: ""Certainly you will find the most violent of people in enmity for those who believe (to be) the Jews and those who are polytheists, and you will certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe (to be) those who say: We are Christians; this is because there are priests and monks among them and because they do not behave proudly. ""

Do you think it's just some enormous and unfortunate cosmic coincidence that they have been persecuted wherever they set foot? God wrote this as well many centuries ago. Read Surat Al Imran, verse 112: ""Shame is pitched over them (Like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds. ""

Notice that first part, a ""covenant from men""; it means God has struck them with fear, so they would never be able to find refuge from persecution or even establish a state except when they are very heavily assisted by others. See European and American contributions to the Jewish state and you'll see how perfectly accurate this is. They can not engage in wars and battles unless they have a ridiculous and overwhelming advantage in numbers, technology, weaponry and international support.

Finally, have you examined the portrayal of Jews in movies and TV shows? It is invariably sympathetic and positive. Jeff Goldblum is the brilliant scientist in Jurassic Park. He saves the day in ID4. Jews are badasses in Inglorious Basterds. They are very funny (see tons of Jewish comedians). They are poor, oppressed and very worthy of your compassion (see any Holocaust movie). They are weak, dorky and nonthreatening. They are heroes who fight side by side with Americans against the forces of evil (Mellish from Private Ryan). I could go on forever, I become extremely sensitive towards Muslim and Jewish portrayals in media in the past years. ",0,,islam,,t1_c3vgpu1,2015-07-01 09:59:29.000000,1970-01-01 01:00:01.000000,

To confess is to submit to a kind of attack. The question is: why submit to an attack? The more the interviewer pushes, the more the attack turns into an attack. There is an internal rebellion against the attack. The interview process is not really supposed to be a court of law, an attack or itself an act of violence. When the person finally confesses, they may in a way be rebelling against the attack aspects of the ""interview"". This means, basically, that as they are being pushed to confess, the interview is being sharpened into a kind of ""point"", like the point of a sword. To refuse to confess is, in a way, to say, ""yes, you have a sword-point, but don't use it on me"". Over time, even in people without an explicit presence of mind to do this, however, the ongoing ""cache"" of the interview suffers a specific degrade: questions are asked which purport to be ""only fact-finding"", in the mode of ""conversation"", maybe with a ""good cop"" playing just that role, etc. As the push happens, the target suffers a basic degrade of something they already enjoy regularly: basic interaction.

Note that in any ordinary interaction, even a slight deviance in the form of a ""pointed"" effort, a distortion, some strategy, etc., may lead to an argument, some rebellion. So say someone is having an issue with someone, in the form of ""normal conversation"", about how they used the coffee maker in the office, *that* target (so to speak) will rebel in a very natural way: hey, you're making too much of an issue with this, etc. An argument may ensue, on the basis of something very slight. That's why such things are called ""slights"".

So in the serious crime interview, this tolerance, which is already rather low, is stretched to an extreme degree. That means there is a smoldering rebellion against this invasion. So as the truth of the interview as a ""sword"" is brought further and further into clarity, the problem the lies in the fact that the interview is lying so much and turning into a sword at all. This ""turning into a sword at all"" is an assault, basically. For the person to not confess, they are basically saying, ""all you are doing here is basically fine, I'm just not guilty"". Whereas, to ""confess"" ultimately may be saying, ""fine, have your (sword) point, I'm guilty, ok? You happy?"" With the point being, this shouldn't be the sword point that it is being forced into being in the first place.

The person has usually already said they were not guilty. But they ""come around"". That's part of the wearing down aspect that is typical for this kind of situation. Again, that ""wearing down"" is also in fact piqueing the internal rebellion. And again, the point here is that one basic form of the rebellion that happens is to give the point to the other, in hopes, probably, of some better setting, scenario -- away from these horrid interviewers -- where the truth can out in a better, less distorted form. But to refuse to confess can ultimately have the form: ""this kind of assault is OK; I just don't happen to be guilty"".

To refuse to confess says: this kind of assault is OK. To confess *may* be saying, in a way that even the confessing person doesn't quite understand -- and a lot of this occurs in the not-quite-understanidng area, *even for the interviewers* -- ""I do not believe in this interview process, hence I give you this 'confession'."" However, again, those quotation marks around ""confession"" themselves may not even be apparent to the target.",0,,Foodforthought,,t1_c3vgyjj,2015-07-01 09:59:17.000000,1970-01-01 01:00:01.000000,

Lengthy video game sessions happen sometimes (right now my friends and I are obsessed with the ME3 multiplayer demo) but it's hardly something I'd say I do regularly.

That's because the packages aren't neatly arranged. And the trucks don't have big blower motors sticking out with chrome 22"" wheels, and a magnaflow exhaust either.

UPS needs a truck that is 'clean' looking on the outside, reliable and has easy access to load and unload while doing the best it can on gas mileage carrying all that weight.

I'm sorry but I have to disagree completely here.  If your paying full retail price for a ""complete"" product and later you find out you have to pay an additional amount to access part of this product that you already paid full price for is shit.

The fact is that you already did pay for it, it already was developed and burned into the disc with the rest of the content.  All you are paying for is a means of ""unlocking"" it.  Imagine going to see a movie, you pay full price for it.  Towards the end of the movie it ends abruptly, saying to see the full ending you need to pay an additional 5 dollars.  Nothing changes about the movie, its all the same but your missing out on some of the content that you already paid for unless you pay for again.

If the movie analogy doesn't work look at cars.  Say you purchase a brand new car.  Apart of the package that you have to get with ""luxuries"" is a full GPS and map system built into the car.  Like it or not this system is built into the car, and its price is included in the final price of the car.  Now, to use the GPS system it costs an additional amount of money.  So for a system you may never use let alone wanted you have to pay for it, thats how it is with locked content on a disc.  It may be fluff, and nothing but pretty skins for fanboys to buy; but in the end it takes up space on the disc that could be used for non-releated DLC.

The people who should be angry are the ones who purchased the game recently with the understanding the further content updates were forthcoming.

I feel for the guy wanting to spend time with his family, but there are ways he could do that while still fulfilling the promises he made to the people who purchased his game, such as opening the Terraria source code.  He could even do it the same way id does with Quake, and open the source without opening the media, thereby protecting his ability to continue to sell the game commercially while officially allowing people to add on to it.

*Forest Gump* beats *Pulp Fiction* and *Shawshank Redemption*.

Then the very next year:

*Braveheart* beats out *Apollo 13*.

The got some iffy calls the next few years, perhaps not my picks but ones that I can at least understand. I would have preferred *LA Confidential* over *Titanic*, but I can't really say it was a slamdunk.

Then **1999** rolls around:

*Saving Private Ryan* wins Best Picture, Director, Actor, Original Screenplay, Cinematography, all the Technicals! *Elizabeth* grabs a much deserved Best Actress... Oh wait. Some fuckwit gives *Shakespeare In Love* Best Picture, Original Screenplay, Actress and Supporting Actress, then several technicals. **What. The. Fuck?**

So they pull back, pull their head out of their collective ass, start thinking for a few years. They get it right with *American Beauty* and *Gladiator*. They get writing credits correct with *Almost Famous*.

Then starts the 3 year travesty of *The Lord of the Rings*. Not only did *A Beautiful Mind* beat *Fellowship of the Ring*, *Chicago* beat *The Two Towers* (possibly the single worst selection of the past 20 years), Sir Ian McKellen does not win one single Supporting Actor award despite actually becoming a fucking wizard for an entire year, fully encompassing one of the greatest characters in one of the greatest stories ever told. Further insult to injury was the one area where I felt that *LotR* had a slam dunk was in Film Editing. This just shows how little these voters know about modern film. *Chicago* beat out some of the most amazing camera tricks, timing edits, multi-layered shots, and pacing a film has ever done with *The Two Towers*.

Then they feel they have to overcompensate and give *Return of the King* pretty much everything (although a much deserved Best Picture and Director, I must admit); except again no Ian-Is-Fucking-Gandalf-the-White-Wizard-McKellen, not even nominated in the epic finale of a role that defined fantasy film forever.

They fuck around for a year or so, then pull off the biggest dumbshit move since 1999. **2006** rolls around and they give *Crash* Best Picture over *Brokeback Mountain* (should have won), *Munich* (highly underrated and a close second), *Capote* and *Good Night and  Good Luck* (both amazing films in their own right and could have won was well). Somehow they picked the absolute *worst* film of the 5. All 4 of those films were miles ahead.

A couple years of iffy calls that I disagree with but still understand, like *The Departed* over *Letters from Iwo Jima* and *Little Miss Sunshine*; they get it right a few more years with *No Country For Old Men*, *Slumdog Millionaire*, *The Hurt Locker*. I was really upset that somehow *Inglourious Basterds* did not get Best Original Screenplay seeing as it was probably the best written film to lose since I've been watching movies.

**2011** Awards... Calm down. Calm down. You can do this:

*The King's Speech*?!? Fucking serious? In a year with *Toy Story 3* (hands down, my pick), *Black Swan*, *127 Hours*, *The Fighter*, *The Social Network*, and *Winter's Bone*? Sure, they expanded the roster to 10, but *The King's Speech* should have just been happy enough to be nominated. *Toy Story 3* is probably the finest animated film ever created, and yes I'm saying that knowing that *Wall-E*, *Akira*, *The Iron Giant*, and *Grave of Fireflies* exist.

That wouldn't include all forms of feminism.  There really are quite a lot of varieties of feminism.  For example, you have [Difference Feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_feminism):

&gt;&gt;Difference feminism is a philosophy that stresses that men and women are ontologically different versions of the human being.

[...]

&gt;&gt;Reverse gender polarity is the form of difference feminism that asserts that women, per se, are superior to men. It developed as the opposite of traditional gender polarity that asserts that men, per se, are superior to women.

[...]

&gt;&gt;Fractional gender complementarity argues that men and women complement one another as separate parts that together make up a composite whole. This form of difference feminism was most prominent in the Cult of True Womanhood developed in reaction to other forms of feminism in the 19th century. It originally developed from a neoplatonic unisex theory that one sexless soul was incarnated into two different bodies: male and female. The two, when added together, were to have formed a single mind.

It was not too long ago, I was living in an appartment by myself. I had a wall-neighbor, who happened to be a lady friend. We had messed around a few times, and we would hang out and game. Fuck-buddies basically. Unbeknownst to me, she was a fucking looney.

But I digress. In our shared wall, we had a little whole in the floorboard, where we would run an ether-net cord through so that we could play lan on Xbox without having to move all our stuff around. We were setting it up one night, and I was feeling a bit frisky. She asks me to snake the wire through, but instead I unzip my pants and put the head of it through the hole. I told her to grab at it, which she did. She couldn't quite get a grip on it, because only the tip of the head was going through. So shes rubbing it, and I'm getting a bit excited and begin to grow, so to speak. 'It' enlarged to the point where I couldn't get it out, but I didn't really think it through, as there was a fairly sexy lady on the other side playing with it.

I guess the size change got her attention, because I heard he give a little gasp. She stops playing at it and yells through the wall at me about being a pervert and what not. I get shes kinda angry, so I try to abort, but find that I'm stuck. I start laughing quite hard, because my dick is stuck in a hole in the wall and shes just screaming at me. I tell her that I'm stuck, and she suddenly gets real quite, then says, ""Well, let me help you get it out."" So now I'm thinking shes gunna lick it till I weaken or something, making me even more excited. I hear her walking away, but the thought of this whole glory-hole situation has got me in a bit of a tizzy. Finally, she returns and says, ""now hold still"".

Excitidly, I prepare for the embrace of her tongue on my man stick. Instead, I feel the most intense pain I have ever experienced. A horrible, constant sharp, buring pain right on the head. I pull back and am able to get out of the hole. I look down and she had **cut off the tip of my dick!** I start freaking out and bleeding everywhere. I hear her cackling on the other side, then see the edge on my penis come shooting through the hole. ""Think you forgot something, you perverted fucker!"" I grab it, run into the kitchen, through it in some nice, and use a towel to try and stop the bleeding as I call 911.

Fast forward and everything went better than expected. The police had found her still cakaling in the corner, apparently she had stopped taking some meds or something. And Mr. Winky got his head sewn back on. It still functions, but boners can sometimes feel a little strained. It has a big, ugly scar running around it. Plus side is my penis now has an awsome nickname: ""FrankenDick"".

I don't engage with r/atheism here. In the past, I just unsubscribbed from r/atheism and just let the remaining streams of abuse flow off my back.

It's one thing for atheists here to bash on me for being an idiot. Never mind my schooling. I don't mind being called illogical. Never mind my published papers. I deal with being routinely called closed-minded and unaccepting. Never mind my extensive resume of volunteer activities, the fact that I have never *once* prostelitized, that I don't hate gays, that I hold liberal opinions on birth control, this, that or the other. Nothing matters. Atheists here just hack away, oblivious.

However, it is apparently not enough to have to deal with you asshole redditors (and maybe not you, ieatoutoftrashcans--but tencircles, orchidkat and reddit in general) continually making jibes at the Catholic Church. Now, three of you decide that it would be awesome to *fuck in our confession booths.* What is wrong with you, reddit? Sex on a piano sounds great. *This* is unacceptable.

This determined, obstinate, and aggressive rudeness strains my patience in ways that I didn't think it could be. I've put up with a lot without saying much in response. So, I guess you should all congratulate yourselves: you finally provoked me.

Before you prematurely point the finger, orchidkat and tencircles, I looked into your comment history on r/atheism, and you guys drink the kool aid. ieatoutoftrashcans, you're sort of, but not entirely, off the hook.

* **Make moderation policy public and transparent.** I know it exists, and it was in private modtalk on the forums, and for some reason, this is still private, probably to keep any moderators from getting flak from breaking the policy, or to keep the admins safe from community criticism on lax policy. For those unaware, this is not the ""rules"" as you can see openly on the wiki, but this is a private moderation guide about how (presumably) they are supposed to act in certain situations. If becoming a moderator is not a promotion, then they are all the same class, so any user should be able to see the moderation policy, even if they are not moderators.

* **Bring back a democratic system to [/r/mcpublic](/r/mcpublic).** That's how it was when I joined, and it made it feel like I was more important, had a voice in the community, and that this place was more free from corruption, as they were accountable to the users, who could vote for a recall if the other admins did nothing. Once admins started electing others to their position, and moderators doing the same, it changed, I felt. *No matter your opinion on my ""controversial"" rules*, there unarguably cannot be a ""becoming a moderator is not a promotion"" statement if users don't get to vote on new mods or admins, but mods and admins can.

* Also, remove most of the moderators of this subreddit. 85 moderators in a &lt;3k subscriber subreddit? Not necessary at all. Limit it to admins, and remove past ones (obviously, this is a task for Nat). No real reason for this other than the ability to abuse it and it just seems like it's too over-the-top.

There is also a lower standard of evidence required for a charge to be filed, and conviction rates in other major crimes are much higher - it's kind of rare that someone gets off a murder charge with widespread doubts about whether he actually did it or not. Not so with rape, when someone gets off often doubts remain about what really happened - justifiably so because many rapists escape punishment even when charged.

From the judicial point of view rape is a most inconvenient crime - it's common, extremely damaging, very difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, easy to falsely accuse someone of if one desires to, juries are borderline schizophrenic about it, etc. Because it's so common and underreported/underconvicted prosecutors are under pressure to file, and because it's so hard to prove trials often devolve into character assassination.

I'm sure that's what the Hyrule Historia says and all, but to be honest I don't believe a word in that thing and quite frankly I couldn't give a shit either way. I actually do like the interpretation of Link being filled with regret: it fits with the context of Link going off on his own, leaving behind the land he once saved. For the way Link's character is presented, that regret is very plausible.

HOWEVER, the way I see this series, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer. The Hyrule Historia is nothing more than the authors giving us the answers, a lot of which are answers I vehemently disagree with (for a number of reasons that I won't get into right now), and even if they weren't it's a practice I am opposed to. The way I see it, authorial intent doesn't matter even in the slightest--it's true of basically any other artistic medium, and it should also be the case for video games.  All we really have to go on is the subject matter presented to us, and as consumers of media it is our job to dissect and interpret it however we see fit. Think of it this way: if J.K. Rowling came out with a detailed text describing that Harry was in fact a mental patient in a hospital in London, and that the entire series occurred in his head, would you believe it? If you answered yes without question, then I feel sorry for you. For me, that interpretation completely ruins the magic of the story.

So yes, the Hyrule Historia interpretation is the most widely accepted interpretation. Again, I like a lot of that interpretation, but I also see holes in the thematic value of it, so I take it with a grain of salt. To be honest, I don't fully believe in my own theory either, as it kind of invalidates the entire adventure. But I like it all the same, as it fits with the dark mood that I love so much about the game. And it's based on in-game, textual evidence; as far as I'm concerned it's completely legitimate. So I'm going to stick with my theories, as they make me happy.

BTW, don't worry about sounding like a dick. I'm afraid I may have come across that way as well, but I didn't mean to be! Basically the point of this comment is to say this: yes, I understand and appreciate the Hyrule Historia interpretation for what it is. But I like my theory as well. Neither of them are ""completely wrong;"" in fact, the only thing that *is* ""wrong"" about any of what we said is that any person can be ""completely wrong"" about anything. It's your game, your experience, look at it the way *you* want to look at it. And that, kids, is why Zelda means so much to me.

Its the internet age where people can voice their opinion instantly and in real time.  The listeners and fanbases are now influencing the music more than ever before. Anyone can create a track, and share it on the internet without having to necessarily go through a record label who demand a certain level of quality.  This means that there is a hell of a lot of average or badly produced music out there and harder to find those gems. You could also argue that artists who have been around for a while are getting bored of the same old stuff too.

I think its a combination of all these things.

EDM currently is blowing up, and there is a ton of new people coming into the scene who know nothing about its roots.  There seems to be a hell of a lot more of them than us loyal fans.

When you put water in your kettle at home. And pour it into your cup for tea/coffee, that's going to be just under 100C.

That's the nature of drinks made with boiling water. They are *hot*. Yes they will scald your skin.

&gt;Liebeck's lawyers presented the jury with evidence that 180 °F (82 °C) coffee like that McDonald’s served may produce third-degree burns (where skin grafting is necessary) in about 12 to 15 seconds. Lowering the temperature to 160 °F (71 °C) would increase the time for the coffee to produce such a burn to 20 seconds. (A British court later rejected this argument as scientifically false finding that 149 °F (65 °C) liquid could cause deep tissue damage in only two seconds.[17])

Even if we take word for word what Liebecks lawyers says (which is kind of absurd), you're still going to get scalded if you have 71C water on you for 20 seconds, instead of 15. That's already 30C lower than most people make coffee at home at. The finding of the british court show that even lower than that, (way lower than is necessary to brew coffee) can burn the fuck out of you.

In my office, we have a water heater with a temperature gauge on it. Right now I have tea in front of me at 97C. That's 25C hotter than McDonalds should supposedly serve.

The bottom line is that Hot drinks will burn you, because water has a high specific heat capacity. That's just how it is.

When you present images of a scalded woman to a jury of 12 people, and a huge (basically Evil) company like mcdonalds, it's easy to side with her. Well McDonalds does a lot of shitty things, but that's no reason to throw thought out the window. We should know that hot drinks (even at 70C) are dangerous if you pour them over yourselves.

* Beautifully crafted semi realistic sci-fi world

* Compelling story muddled down somewhat by the forced ignorance of everyone about the reapers. What I mean that for some reason no one takes the Reaper threat seriously and Shepard doesn't seem to be able to produce any evidence even though according to Ashely we have suit Recordings. So our suits basically record everything we go through but we won't use this as evidence? Really? Or how about melding our minds with the Asari council member to share the visions? Or melding our minds with someone aside from Liara who the council can trust? This is even more ridiculous when you consider that the only evidence they needed about Saren was a bad quality audio recording. Yet all the evidence about reapers is completely ignored.

* Combat was somewhat average but the infinite ammo and your biotic/tech powers made it feel reasonably fresh and new

* The entire feel of the game was very nice. Shepard was a simple soldier drawn into this conflict due to an accident. The game didnt't go out of it's way to present Shepard in any way but rather left it up to the players to decide how their Shepard would be

* A lot of recycled and dull environments. That one building with the same layout on almost every single planet, every single research center looked the same and so on.

* Mako. The really jumpy and floaty nature of Mako made it fun to control on certain types of planet, but if you were on a rocky planet or something with a lot of steep mountains/rocks moving around was a pain in the ass.

* Too much loot. There were tons of loot for everything and every encounter got you ridiculous amounts of loot. My inventory filled up without me evne really paying attention to anything. This also made money parctically a non issue in the game since you could go somewhere and kill a bunch of enemies and get millions by selling the loot

* Weapons felt pretty much the same. Regardless of what Shotgun or assault rifle you used they all felt very much the same, weapon mods and bullets added some differentiation but the weapons themselves could really have used something to differentiate them.

**Mass Effect 2:**

* One of the shittiest plots I have seen in video game history, ever. The main plot was absolutely retarded on so many levels.

* Killing Shepard was dumb and pointless

* Greatly improved combat which felt far more exciting than anything in ME1

* Thermal clips are bad.

* Your could interact more with your crew and find out much more about them.

* Forced romances are bad. Why can't I just talk to Miranda without trying to get into her pants? This makes it so that I can't really get to know most of my crew because otherwise I'll start to romance them.

* Awfully implemented loyalty system. Not loyal &gt; Do mission &gt; Totally loyal. Loyalty doesn't work like that.

* On the other hand a lot of the loyalty missions were great and we got to know our crew much better through them.

* The characters overall were very good, aside from Shepard who is basically pointless.

* Forcing the ""bad ass"" status. This bugged me to no end. I didn't want to be some generic action hero, the first game didn't make me into one, so why does the second force me to this mold?

* Too little loot. There were only a handful of weapons you could find in the game which was a bit disappointing. They went from one extreme (Too much loot) to another (practically no loot). I hope that ME3 has some mroe stuff to loot.

* Planet scanning is boring, dull, repetitive and just pointless.

* The game had some genuinely funny moments and some great dialogue amongst your crew. Mordin's impromptu song comes comes to mind as one of the high points.

* Forcing you to play either a full paragon or renegade to play the game through ""well"". What I'm referring to are the two crew conflicts towards the end where you need to have very high paragon or renegade rating to resolve them peacefully and retain the loyalty of the crewmembers. This is just slly since the game practically punishes me from having complex motivations and choosing to react to different situations in different ways. If I don't play a very paragon/renegade character I will fail to resolve these conflicts resulting in lost loyalty.

* Why get rid of weapon mods?

Google uses something like 20x more bandwidth than it pays for — why should ATT cover the expanded cost of Google's more and more bandwidth intensive services.

To me, a lot of the reason some of these companies are so successful is not that they are particularly revolutionary, innovative, or have found a way to monetize a new market — but that they have discovered asymmetries in markets and exploit the arbitrage opportunity. For example, Dropbox is not financially successful because it is easy to use and people like it; it is successful because through hashing, they can store a file once and count that file toward an infinite number of users quotas, in essence selling the same disk space over and over again. Similarly, Facebook figured out a way to get millions of people to act as unpaid data entry slaves by leveraging the asymmetric influence of their network; same with Google, which you basically have to allow to index your site (at your own cost of bandwidth) or risk irrelevancy.

The problem is this actually has a dampening effect on the entire digital economy, because as long as Facebook and Google are subsidized by the rest of humanity, they have no or little incentive to really figure out the best ways to monetize their content and services, creating an artificial downward pressure on everything that happens online; making people believe in fallacies like content is dead, or that you must compete with free. Things are not free, or as cheap as they appear to be — but social advertising doesn't really work for Facebook yet and Google's long tail is having trouble converting away from text. If they weren't offsetting their costs of doing business so massively, they would never be able to stay in business.

People love to waive around network neutrality; but this isn't about network neutrality. The simple fact is that the internet has been corporatized, commercialized, and is now a capitalist market. Network neutrality was relevant back in the day when it was educational institutions, government agencies, and not for profits. If you want to return to those days, I'm all for net neutrality — BUT in the case of the modern internet, where it is no longer a bunch of docile collaborators eagerly looking toward the future, but rather a maniacal swarm of corporations, you need to let the market set the terms, because otherwise you're just enforcing a subsidy for one group of corporations, at the expense of another, and in that situation, it is always the consumer that suffers.",0,,politics,,t1_c3vvpb2,2015-07-01 09:40:12.000000,1970-01-01 01:00:01.000000,

This is a good question to ask. If more people asked themselves that question before they attempted to make images of sexuality, there might be a higher rate of imagery which met that standard. But in order for that to happen, more people need to understand how fundamental rape culture is, in that it is practically the operating system of society.

Making ""it"" in a way such that ""it"" isn't rape is an extraordinary task because it requires getting outside of rape culture, and getting outside of pornographic tropes.

In that sense, as well as it being a good question, it's unfortunately not a very interesting one, because the answer loops back around to: ""Well, it would be very very difficult, and you might need to end rape culture first, and *anyway*, while we spend a month or so talking about that, rape porn is still being produced and actually, can't we talk about that please instead of this niche subject which is *always* used to derail conversations about it?""

After all, it's reasonable to expect that if a partner is watching porn as per the OP's question, they haven't first purchased an isolated island in the ocean, raised their own society on that island without introducing rape culture and then solicited fantasies and consensually constructed erotic imagery from within that island's culture. We're talking about partners watching mainstream porn. Rape porn.",0,,SRSDiscussion,,t1_c3vvqjc,2015-07-01 09:40:27.000000,,

And more than *1000* bears are killed *each year* in British Columbia for the same reason:

There are also fines for attracting wildlife in this manner. Jasper and Banff national parks have the same problem with people providing food for bears, and have enacted a policy to secure human waste away from bears. It works great.

I understand a lot of people don't like the tar sands. I'm not a particular fan either, this is my province and I care about the environment. But this has nothing to do with the tar sands.

2. Most of the world largely failed to accept Jewish immigration prior to and during the Holocaust, including the British acceding to Arab pressure and preventing Jews from reaching Palestine before and during World War II.  There was guilt.
3. The need for a Jewish homeland was felt much more keenly after the Holocaust, and the West and Russia felt this was a legitimate goal.
4. There was no independent country of Palestine, it was a Turkish possession which passed to the British under a League of Nations Mandate. Zionist immigration had been occurring since the 19th century, along with Arab immigration to the region.
5. The Arabs and Palestinians failed to accept a UN Partition agreement that was far more generous than anything they're ever likely to be offered again.
6. The Arabs then attacked the Israelis and lost
7. The Israelis are staunch allies of the United States.
8. The Israelis successfully opposed dangerous pan-Arab nationalism
9.  The Israelis have been the defender three times against massed Arab armies
10. They have been fighting a nasty guerrilla war for decades
10. Their opponents in the guerrilla war have spent decades denying the right of Israel to exist
11. Their opponents in the guerrilla war spent decades being untrustworthy and uninterested in a peace agreement

That pretty much sums it up.  Instead of behaving dangerously all the time, the Palestinians seem to have developed some intervals of lucidity over the last decade and a half, so it will be interesting to see if a deal can be made.",0,,worldpolitics,,t1_c3vvss7,2015-07-01 09:40:56.000000,,

Just because INTUC supported the strike does not means anything with regards to what these strikes achieve in India changes . I know that reddit in general like to believe that unions actually accomplish something. Not the case anymore.They used to when the leaders of the union actually believed in worker rights. Now it is not the case, at least in India.
Anyway what do they want? They want govt to control prices. Care to explain how. The govt is running a huge fiscal deficit mainly due to subsidies. Govt has no control over import fuel prices which are subsidized by the way. It is not going to stop throwing away money to get votes. So, please do tell me how a strike is going to make the govt control prices.
They want the govt not to sell off profit making public sector units. But that is the only way left for government to bring in revenue to cut fiscal deficit. Also the unions do not want private players to come in because, god forbid, they actually have to work. The indian PSU's are one of the most inefficient organizations around when it comes to productivity.
So what else do they want? They want to prevent violation of labor laws. This is just a euphemism for ""I do not want to work. But you also cannot fire me"".
Striking does not accomplish anything in the context of their demands. You want to change. Ask govt to cut subsidies, reduce wasteful expenditure on things like MNREGA and root out corruption.

You don't just have activists at play in these grass vs grain arguments, you have countries like Uruguay who do less CAFOs because it takes a high initial investment to create one.

Almost all cattle are first pastured or grazed, they're only finished on feed lots, and only an idiot would attempt feeding them 100% grain. Much of the grain fed to cattle is what's called distillers grains. It's what's left after the starch from grains(usually corn in the US) has been converted to ethanol in grain to fuel plants, and grain to alcoholic beverages. Basically it's the best parts of the grain from a nutritional stand point, and again, cattle aren't fed 100% of even distillers grains.

I'm not making an argument for crowded conditions for livestock, I'm just trying to dispel some common myths that circulate on the web and won't die.

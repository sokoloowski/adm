# [Advanced data mining docs](README.md) - project ideas

---

***With 150GB of Reddit posts spanning eight years***, you have a rich dataset to explore various data mining projects.

### Our ideas:

- Trend Analysis: Track the frequency of certain keywords or topics over time. This can reveal how discussions evolve or how certain events influence conversations.
- User Behavior Analysis: Investigate user engagement by analyzing factors like post popularity, comment volume, and user activity patterns. Identify influential users or communities.
- Network Analysis: Construct a network of interactions (comments, replies) to analyze community dynamics. This can highlight clusters of active users or influential nodes in discussions.
- Meme Evolution Study: Track the evolution of popular memes or trends across Reddit, analyzing how they spread and change over time.
- Comment Analysis: Dive into the comment sections to analyze the nature of discussions, such as toxicity levels, agreement/disagreement patterns, or information diffusion.
- Up & down votes analysis: Analyze the up and down votes of posts and comments to understand user preferences and community sentiment.
- Author classification: Classify authors based on their posting behavior, content, or engagement patterns. This can help identify different user archetypes or personas.

### Here are some other project ideas:

- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of posts over time. You can examine how sentiments change in response to significant events, trends, or subreddits.
- Topic Modeling: Use techniques like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify common topics and themes over the years. This can help uncover emerging trends or shifts in community interests.
- Predictive Modeling: Build models to predict the popularity of posts based on features such as title, content, or timing. This could involve regression analysis or machine learning techniques.
- Comparative Analysis: Compare the discussions across different subreddits to identify unique characteristics, user demographics, or trends.
- Emotion Detection: Extend sentiment analysis to detect specific emotions (e.g., joy, anger, fear) using more nuanced models like BERT or other transformer-based architectures.
- Temporal Analysis of Rhetoric: Investigate how the rhetoric or language used in posts changes over time, particularly in response to social issues, political events, or memes.
- Text Summarization: Create algorithms that summarize long threads or discussions to provide concise insights into popular topics.
- Community Structure Analysis: Explore the growth and structure of subreddits, identifying key moments of expansion or decline in certain communities.

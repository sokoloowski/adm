## Classification

Classification is a supervised learning technique that is used to predict the category of a given data point. The categories are often binary (e.g., spam/not spam), but can also be multi-class (e.g., cat, dog, horse). The objective of classification is to develop a model that can accurately predict the category of a new data point based on its features.

There are many different classification algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

The following section presents an analysis of the five classifiers available in the Scikit Learn library, which were tested against the available loss functions.

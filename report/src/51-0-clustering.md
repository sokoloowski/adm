## Clustering

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity. The objective of clustering is to group data points with similar characteristics together and to separate those with dissimilar characteristics. Clustering is employed in a variety of applications, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image segmentation.

There are many different clustering algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular clustering algorithms include k-means, agglomerative clustering and k-medoids.

The results demonstrated that, in the context of our dataset, clustering is not the optimal solution. This is due to the fact that the clusters are not distinct, as evidenced by the Silhouette Coefficient [@rousseeuw1987silhouettes]. This coefficient can assume a value within the range of -1 to 1, where -1 indicates that the clusters are ill-defined, 0 signifies that the clusters are overlapping, and 1 denotes that the clusters are well-defined. In our particular case, the Silhouette Coefficient consistently exhibits values that are close to 0.

Despite the suboptimal results, we chose to complete the clustering experiment and examine the outcomes across different algorithms. For the analysis, we employed dimensionality reduction using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). According to the Scikit Learn documentation, unlike Principal Component Analysis (PCA), this estimator does not center the data before performing the SVD, which allows it to efficiently process sparse matrices. Truncated SVD is applied to term count or tf-idf matrices generated by the vectorizers, a technique commonly referred to as Latent Semantic Analysis.

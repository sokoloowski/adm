## Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group data points based on their similarities. The primary goal of clustering is to organize data into clusters where the points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters. This method is widely used in applications such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image segmentation. Various clustering algorithms exist, each with its advantages and limitations. Some of the most common clustering algorithms include **k-means**, **agglomerative clustering**, and **k-medoids**.

For our dataset, the clustering experiment did not yield optimal results. This is due to the lack of well-defined clusters, as evidenced by the **Silhouette Coefficient** [@rousseeuw1987silhouettes]. The Silhouette Coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates poorly defined clusters, 0 suggests overlapping clusters, and 1 represents well-separated clusters. In our case, the Silhouette Score consistently hovered around 0, indicating that the clusters formed were not distinct.

Despite these unsatisfactory results, we decided to proceed with the clustering experiment and explore the performance of various algorithms. For dimensionality reduction, we used **truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. Unlike **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, which centers the data before performing the decomposition, truncated SVD does not, making it more suitable for processing sparse matrices. This method is commonly used in **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)**, where term count or **TF-IDF** matrices generated by vectorizers are subjected to SVD for dimensionality reduction.

We experimented with multiple clustering algorithms, operating under the assumption that data from different subreddits would show meaningful distinctions across categories. However, the results remained disappointing, with all clustering attempts yielding Silhouette Scores close to 0, signaling poor cluster separation. Given these subpar outcomes, we decided to abandon clustering and pivot to **classification**, which is explored in the next section.
